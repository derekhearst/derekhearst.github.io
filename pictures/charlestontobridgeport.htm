				Getting the boat from Charleston SC to Bridgeport CT</span></p>

<div style="position: absolute; left: 107px; top: 314px; width: 524px; height: 778px; z-index: 4" id="layer4">
				<p style="font-size: medium" class="style17"><span lang="en-US">
				The boat was hauled at Pierside Boatworks in Charleston, SC.&nbsp; 
				They were a great help.&nbsp; We had Blue Water Surveys do our 
				inspection with lasted a full 10 hours and was extremely in 
				depth.&nbsp; Kris had driven down for the inspection and then 
				spent the five days cleaning&nbsp; and cleaning and cleaning. 
				and prep for moving the boat north.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">Now that we purchased the 
				boat we needed to work on it closer to home, that 14 hour drive 
				from CT to SC is not one that allows for simple projects.&nbsp; 
				With Dean not able to get two weeks off and Derek in school the 
				task fell onto Kris to move the boat up.&nbsp; We found a couple 
				of cheap deck hands, Kris’s dad, Norm, and Dean’s older brother, 
				Lee.&nbsp; Both flew out from the west coast the day before and 
				other than Norm’s luggage being lost the start of the journey 
				was uneventful.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">We had mapped out several 
				anchorages on the Inland Coastal Way and headed out.&nbsp; Of 
				course no trip is complete without running aground, which&nbsp; 
				we promptly did the first day,&nbsp; while Lee was at the helm.&nbsp; 
				Not blaming Lee, these things are always the captains fault.&nbsp; 
				We were able to kedge off quite quickly, and resumed the trip.&nbsp; 
				As we had limited time, we mostly motored our way north, but did&nbsp; 
				get some nice sails in.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">We had some memorable 
				moments, nearly hit a buoy in the alligator river, army flares 
				shot over the bow, and numerous ground nudges while searching 
				the soft mud for good anchoring.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">During the trip we found 
				and fixed many boat problems, but one persistent one, was 
				running out of battery power to run things.&nbsp; That meant 
				that every other night we had&nbsp; to stay at a marina to get 
				power recharged.&nbsp; This was great for Norm, as he preferred 
				buying dinner out versus cooking any time.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">We spent about 5 hours at 
				one spot trying to fix the autopilot for the offshore leg of the 
				journey.&nbsp; As is usual on a boat, it took 4 hours to get to 
				the problem, and one hour to fix it.&nbsp; The boat had a poor 
				design issue for accessing some of the electronics, but that is 
				now fixed.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">One of the more unpleasant 
				experiences was finding that the macerator that chops up the 
				stuff coming from the holding tank before it gets pumped over 
				was leaking a thin stream of brown fluid into the bilge.&nbsp; 
				Needless to say, the odor alerted us to the problem.&nbsp; Of 
				course this is the captains job to fix, and Kris particularly 
				enjoyed holding her hand over the brown fountain coming from the 
				holding tank while trying to reroute the lines to bypass the 
				macerator.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">One marina we particularly 
				enjoyed was one we were not planning on stopping at, but did.&nbsp; 
				Alligator River Marina is small, but the people there were 
				great, and made it a memorable experience.</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">Derek took a day off of 
				school toward the end of the trip and was able to join us to go 
				through New York harbor and cruise by the Statue of Liberty.&nbsp;
				</span></p>
				<p><span lang="en-US" class="style17">Total time was two weeks 
				and we were on a mooring in Captains Cove in Bridgeport, CT.&nbsp; 
				Great trip with lots of lessons learned, and faith in the boat 
				and crew.</span></p>

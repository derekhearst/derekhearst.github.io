          were a few items that did not work ideal.&nbsp; We tend to work off a
          list and so the list was started and is still on going.&nbsp;

          extra thru hull in both heads and glassed over the hole.&nbsp; New
          holding tank in port head.&nbsp; Now the particularly unpleasing odor
          the boat had is completely gone and everyone is much happier.</span

          ><strong>Electrical: </strong>&nbsp;One of the reasons we did not have
          power to start with is we found the alternators on the engine were not
          properly connected to the main power, and the solar panels were not
          hooked up properly as well.&nbsp; That is now fixed with some basic
          rewiring, and the addition of a blue sky solar controller, but we will
          need to add two more panels, and some combiners to the electrical
          system.&nbsp; When we purchased the boat the batteries were dry, so
          chances are we need new batteries, but will tackle that later.</span

          fix.&nbsp; We had to do some repairs on the autopilot controller on
          the trip up from South Carolina, and then it went out again after an
          electrical storm.&nbsp; We put in a new controller, and new wind speed
          direction unit as well.</span

            The windlass worked well on the maiden voyage, but while doing
            routine maintenance found two sheared off bolts and lots of
            rust.&nbsp; We tried to disassemble and repair, but ended up having
            to purchase a new Lewmar windlass after all.</span

          ><strong>Engines:</strong> A small oil lead in the starboard engine
          was not a small problem to fix, but it was nice to do maintenance on
          the engines.&nbsp; Both engines had the exhaust elbow cleaned, heat
          exchangers cleaned, new raw water valves and strainers, new fuel
          filters, new gaskets, oil changes and filters.</span

          bearings, one steering quadrant, four cable ends, and finally the
          grease fitting.</span

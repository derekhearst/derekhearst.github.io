          >95% of our boating experience has been on mono hulls, mainly racing
          from J22s to a Beneteau 45. Kris’s dad owns a F27 trailer trimaran
          that we have sailed a few times.&nbsp; In 1992 Dean and Kris purchased
          a 36 foot Cascade mono hull and cruised the western coast of the US
          and into Mexico.&nbsp; This is a light weight boat, 12,000 lbs, and as
          we came down the coast the boat usually only needed its jib up to hit
          boat speed.&nbsp; In the Sea of Cortez the light winds were not an
          issue for our boat and we could usually sail from anchorages to
          anchorages.&nbsp; The anchorages were all fairly deep and the boat was
          easily handled with just one person.&nbsp; We sailed for two years and
          then went back to the world of making money and being on solid
          ground.</span

          >Based upon all the great people and families we met on our first
          cruise we talked about going again when our son was 10 to 12.&nbsp;
          The opportunity has now come up so we started to look for a boat that
          would fit our family.&nbsp; Our needs now are slightly different then
          when we went the first time.&nbsp; We thought a slightly heavier boat
          would be nice, we wanted to have a shallow draft for the islands&nbsp;
          and our son’s dog would be joining us as well so we wanted easy access
          in and out of the dingy.

          >We started with many mono hulls on our mind but eventually went and
          looked at a catamaran which fit our needs very nicely.&nbsp; After
          deciding two hulls vs. one the real work began because we did not know
          much about the multihull designs or performance.&nbsp; The price of a
          multihull compared to a mono hull is higher and so that limited our
          choices as well.&nbsp; Our list narrowed down to a Gemini 105, for two
          it would have been nice but 3 and a dog just made it too small.&nbsp;
          A PDQ 36 looked good but we thought with a dog it would be nice to
          have a larger dinning/entry area.&nbsp; We looked at a Victory 35, and
          a Prout 37 as well.&nbsp; Since we have cruised before, we had an idea
          of what we wanted, and non of these met our criteria.&nbsp; We saw
          many boats we liked online, but unfortunately our budget did not like
          them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dean finally spotted a boat on Craiglist that we had
          ruled out as too expensive, but this one we could afford.&nbsp; After
          looking at it, we knew it was the boat for us.&nbsp; So far, we are
          very happy with the Manta 38 Catamaran.</span

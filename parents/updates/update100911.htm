				While the nations capital, Washington DC, has a lot to offer it 
				became too cold to enjoy so we headed south.&nbsp; The sailing 
				we have expected to be some what enjoyable but look at the 
				bundled up Dean -&nbsp; does he look like he is having fun.&nbsp; 
				Well it is better than work but who would have thought the foul 
				weather gear would be needed.&nbsp; Its not so much for rain, 
				but for the cold weather.&nbsp; We now have&nbsp; entered 
				Virginia and North Carolina where the temperatures are still 
				cool but at least warms up to shorts and t-shirt weather during 
				the day as shown by Kris, it is much better :).<br />
				<br />
				The trip from Norfolk to Beaufort is usually through the Inter 
				Coastal Waterway, ICW, but you have two options.&nbsp; We took 
				the Dismal Swamp Canal Route.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris had seen the 
				other route but also in Uncle Scrooge comics (one of Kris&#39;s 
				heroes), he spent some time in the swamp and Kris wanted to 
				experience the area.&nbsp; The Dismal Swamp history goes back to 
				George Washington and has quite a colorful history, see the web 
				link if you want more info.&nbsp; It was actually quite a nice 
				trip down the canal, and we spent the night at the visitors 
				center.&nbsp; There is a free dock to tie up to.&nbsp; You 
				actually tie up to a free dock and walk up to the rest stop 
				which is off the highway, so folks stopping at the rest stop 
				walk down and look at your boat.&nbsp; You can walk across the 
				canal on a pedestrian bridge to a nice visitor center that tells 
				all about the Dismal Swamp, and take a walk on an elevated 
				boardwalk though the swamp. It is really quite nice.<br />
				<br />
				Once through the canal, you enter a winding river with Cypress 
				trees on either side that is quite scenic and end&nbsp; up at a 
				town called Elizabeth City, NC.&nbsp; To encourage boaters they 
				have a free 48 hour dock.&nbsp; We felt encouraged so have 
				stopped here.&nbsp; We would like to stay longer, but with the 
				winds coming now out of the ENE, this will become an 
				uncomfortable place to stay so we will leave tomorrow.&nbsp;
				<br />
				We had a nice little wine and cheese party at the dock tonight 
				and got together with most the other boats here and had a good 
				social hour and met some other cruisers.&nbsp; Derek was bored 
				with no other kids so he went back to the boat and played a 
				video game while the adults socialized.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Tomorrow we will head to Alligator River Marina.&nbsp; Kris 
				stopped here with Dean&#39;s brother Lee and her Dad Norm while 
				bringing the boat up from South Carolina and had fond memories, 
				so we will stop on the way down so Dean and Derek can see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Our next big stop will be Oriental, N.C. where we will meet our 
				friends Bob and Anne on their boat Baloo.&nbsp; We first me Bob 
				and Anne back in 1993 when they were at the same dock as us 
				getting ready for our first cruising adventure, as they were as 
				well.<br />

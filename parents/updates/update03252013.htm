      Well, we went to leave Fajardo, and guess what - the engine would not
      start again.&nbsp;&nbsp; The anchor was partway up and Kris had a major
      breakdown and long story short - the anchor went back down and a mechanic
      was called to fix the engine.&nbsp; We could not get one that day, but
      first thing the next morning he came out, and got it running.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      The moral of the engine story is - its a boat - what did you expect?<br />
      Kris&#39;s worked with the fuel injector - which of course caused a wiring
      problem in the relay area (it wasn&#39;t the relay after all, but a
      corroded wire underneath the relay) - which of course led us to not
      getting fuel and the fuel filter clogged because the rubber primer bulb
      decayed and plugged the fuel line.&nbsp; And of course these all happened
      simultaneously making logical thought process to problem solving all but
      worthless.&nbsp; Hey - its a boat!<br />
      <br />
      Anyway, with a now functioning engine - somewhat - there is still
      something fishy going on&nbsp; - we moved to Culebra.&nbsp; This is an
      island just east of Puerto Rico, governed by Puerto Rico.&nbsp; We went
      snorkeling on a reef and it was the largest and most diverse one
      yet.&nbsp; It had taken some bad damage in a hurricane and is still
      recovering, but it was beautiful snorkeling.&nbsp; We saw several turtles
      and a small pair of rays gliding along gracefully, and numerous small
      colorful fish.<br />
      <br />
      The other night we went to dinner at &quot;Zaco&#39;s Tacos&quot; and had
      a great meal.&nbsp; We ate on the outdoor shaded patio, and the kids
      played in the tire swing and watched the chickens running around the
      deck.&nbsp; The food was delicious, and the dessert - mud pie and southern
      style banana pudding pie was the best I have ever eaten.<br />
      <br />
      There are several boats in the harbor, and of course, several that never
      leave as Culebra is one of those spots that is easy to get to and hard to
      leave as it is just so nice.

        >Well, as you know, we had to get some things fixed on the boat.&nbsp;
        The big blow did some damage, and we had a list of things that we wanted
        to do once we got back to the states - but first we had some folks to
        visit.<br />
        <br />
        We stopped at Rowayton, CT and saw a great fireworks show, and connected
        with our friends the Stolbas.&nbsp; Derek was very happy to see his old
        buddies Chaz and Dylan, and ended up going home with the Stolbas for the
        next week.<br />
        <br />
        Kris and Dean then took the boat to&nbsp; Captains Cove Marina in
        Bridgeport, CT, which is where we had the boat before we left.&nbsp; We
        caught up with lots of folks, who were nice enough to buy us dinner or
        lunch or have us to their homes for dinner.&nbsp; It was really nice to
        see everyone, and a special thanks to John for letting us mail a bunch
        of stuff to his house, and for him bringing to the boat.<br />
        <br />
        While in Bridgeport, we spoke with our insurance, and had a person come
        out and fix our electronics, so that is done - kind of - the bow depth
        instrument stopped working the day after he got it working.&nbsp; Kris
        will putz with it for a while and see what she can do.<br />
        <br />
        We moved down to Stamford, CT for the rest of the repairs to be close to
        Hathaway&#39;s Sails and rigging.&nbsp; They have done a terrific job
        helping us out, getting obscure parts, and free advice on how to fix the
        stuff.&nbsp; They are a bunch of great folks.&nbsp; Also highly
        recommended is KAF Manufacturing. - a machine shop in Stamford that
        fixed the take off pulley for the engine while I waited and gave me a
        good deal on the price.&nbsp; Great bunch of guys.<br />
        <br />
        For you sailors, our list of projects is as follows: repair boom vang,
        repair boom gooseneck fitting, install new sheave box for jib, get new
        jib halyard, repair jib stitching and get new batten (lost at sea),
        order new camber spar for jib, fix bow depth sounder, fix radar, find
        machine shop to make new engine take off pulley, fix dinghy cover, new
        zipper in mainsail, resew jib cover zipper, install antifreeze overflows
        in engines, fix oil leak in starboard engine, replace broken shower
        pump, install new A/C pump, and the list goes on, but those are the big
        ones.<br />
        <br />
        We have lots of things to order for spares, now that we know a bit more
        about what we need, and in another week we should have the boat mostly
        ship shape for the next year or so.&nbsp; We have been working steady
        the whole week, and are feeling rather put out about it, as we are used
        to a much more relaxed pace, but it will be nice to have it all done.<br />
        <br />
        Kris is excited about one purchase, we got a small washing machine for
        the boat.&nbsp; It will only do a few things at a time, but will save on
        that big marathon laundry day at the laundromat once a month, and save
        some money in the long run.&nbsp; Now we just need to find a plumbing
        store to get the fittings to hook it up.<br />
        <br />
        One thing about cruising, is having a friend allow you to ship stuff to
        their house is a great treat.&nbsp; We were able to pre order stuff and
        have it waiting for us in CT.&nbsp; All projects take longer because
        there is no car, and you have to find a place to leave the dinghy, then
        walk to your destination and back, which leave less time on the boat for
        working.&nbsp; Both Hathaways and KAF offered us rides, which was really
        great.&nbsp; All our friends up here in CT have offered us rides, or let
        us ship stuff to their houses, and delivered it - can&#39;t say how much
        we appreciate that.<br /> </span

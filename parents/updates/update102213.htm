      Well, we finally moved the boat a fair distance - we sailed the 80 miles
      down to Trinidad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chagaraumas, Trinidad is known as the place
      to get work on your boat done.&nbsp; Supposedly it is cheaper in
      Trinidad.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We had two other boats that we are friends with heading down to get work
      done, so we decided to make the trip as well.&nbsp; We really did not need
      work done, but were interested in seeing Trinidad.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did have
      one repair, and that was on our air conditioning unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our air
      conditioner only works when we are at dock, and can plug into shore power,
      but last time we did that, one of the units did not function.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      We had a nice sail to Trinidad overnight, and when we got in, were very
      disappointed in the main anchorage.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were told that there
      were moorings you could take for $5 a day, but they were all full, and the
      rest of the anchorage was in very deep water with poor
      holding.&nbsp;&nbsp; The water was quite filthy, with oil and debris. We
      started calling around an found a marina that could take us for three
      days, so we went with that option.&nbsp; The marina was very reasonable at
      $28 per day so we were happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Derek was happy about the small
      pool at the marina.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We were able to get our air-conditioning fixed, and enjoyed three days of
      a very cool boat inside, and Derek had his friends over every day for pool
      time which everyone enjoyed.&nbsp; The other fun activity was to watch
      some movies on What If in the air-conditioned boat.<br />
      <br />
      When our marina time was up, we moved to a different anchorage which was
      nicer, but still a bit rolly, and only marginally cleaner water.&nbsp;
      This anchorage was next to the Trinidad and Tobago Sailing Association
      though, and for $45 a week we had use of the facilities which included a
      pool, internet, and a nice covered area to sit at.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there
      it was a mile or more walk into the boating area of town, or a bus ride
      into a nice town in Trinidad.<br />
      <br />
      We took a bus to town a couple of times, and went to a couple of malls,
      and even got in a trip to the PriceSmart store which is like a little
      Costco or Sams Club.&nbsp;&nbsp; We stocked up on toilet paper, paper
      towels and some grocery items, but contrary to what we had heard - prices
      here were not that cheap.<br />
      <br />
      We didn&#39;t stay long in Trinidad, but from what we saw, there is no
      reason we would head back.&nbsp; If we needed work done on the boat and
      had booked a marina or were hauling the boat out of the water - then
      maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp; For us it didn&#39;t make sense to stay longer,
      especially since Sam was forbidden to go ashore in Trinidad (they have
      strict pet rules there).&nbsp; So, only after a week, we headed back to
      Grenada.

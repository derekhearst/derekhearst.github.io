				Do you know why some English are called &quot;Limeys&quot;?&nbsp; 
				According to one of our cruising guides in the early days the 
				English sailors used to eat limes to ward off scurvy.&nbsp; When 
				they were in port they were to lounge around &quot;to lime&quot; and that 
				came to mean &quot;hang out&quot;.&nbsp; Not sure that is very important 
				but we are always trying to become better educated :).<br />
				<br />
				We made it from St. Martin down to Antigua on an overnight 
				passage.&nbsp; The winds were light, seas were under 3 feet and 
				we motor sailed our way south to Antigua getting in around noon.&nbsp; 
				The island has a long history with the English Navy and was the 
				British&#39;s main naval station in the Lesser Antilles.&nbsp; 
				Antigua is 54 square miles and has 80,000 people living on it.&nbsp; 
				We just missed the famous Antigua race week which is held every 
				year in late April and it brings many a sailboat racer down to 
				enjoy the sun and winds.<br />
				<br />
				Antigua has some hills/mountains, 1,300 feet for it&#39;s tallest.&nbsp; 
				We ended up sailing north to Barbuda and that has it&#39;s tallest 
				elevation of 125 feet.&nbsp; Both islands have lots of protected 
				anchorages so you can sail/motor just a few miles and find a new 
				anchorage with few or no boats to share it with.&nbsp; On 
				Barbuda they have a beach that is 16 miles long with lots of 
				pink sand, yes it is really pink.&nbsp; Barbuda is also home to 
				Frigate birds, the largest rookery in the Eastern Caribbean.&nbsp; 
				It also has wild horses, deer and donkeys, we did hear the 
				donkeys one night for several hours.<br />
				<br />
				The area around Antigua/Barbuda is suppose to be great for 
				snorkeling/diving.&nbsp; There are many reefs you can pick from 
				and while the reefs have taken a hit from the storms/hurricanes 
				there is new growth and lots of wildlife to watch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				We snorkeled a bit in Barbuda, and saw a large turtle and 
				several rays in addition to the normal fishes we always see.&nbsp; 
				The reef had been hit hard by a hurricane, and had lots of 
				damage, but it was slowly regrowing.<br />
				<br />
				Right now we are in North Sound on Antigua - see map in 
				pictures, and will make our way around the island to visit 
				English and Falmouth Harbors before we set sail further south.&nbsp; 
				We have to be near Grenada by July 1 for hurricane season.<br />
				<br />
				Kris gave Sam a haircut the other day to help keep him cool, as 
				it is getting warmer with summer coming on.&nbsp; She went a 
				little shorter than she normally does, and Sam looks a bit 
				funny, but he seems happy and much cooler.&nbsp; Dean and Derek 
				giggle when they look at him, for only his tail and ears have 
				any long hair.</div>

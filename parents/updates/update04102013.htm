				We left Calabria and sailed east to the&nbsp; U.S. Virgin 
				Islands.&nbsp; We met up with another boat &quot;Windswept&quot;, who has 
				a boy on board and we had spent time with them in the Bahamas 
				last year.&nbsp; It was good to catch up on things with them and 
				Derek enjoyed having a Minecraft fest with Toby off &quot;Windswept&quot;.&nbsp;
				<br />
				<br />
				We anchored in the main town of Charlotte Amalie in St. Thomas 
				and were able to watch several cruise ships come in here almost 
				every morning and leave every evening.&nbsp; There are lots of 
				tourist stores here and since it is duty free it is the main 
				cruise ship shopping stop for trinkets and do-dads for the 
				cruise ship visitors.&nbsp; It was fun to watch them come in and 
				out, and watch the very white and sometimes very burnt tourists 
				wander about.<br />
				<br />
				While in St. Thomas we did our fair share of shopping, but ours 
				was at marine parts stores and the&nbsp; grocery store.&nbsp; To 
				get to the non-tourist shopping areas where prices were cheaper 
				we rode the Safari bus - which is actually just a truck with a 
				modified bed and benches and a roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only $2 
				per person for a 30 minute ride to almost any store you need.<br />
				<br />
				We did some sightseeing and took a hike up the 99 steps 
				(actually 103) that lead to Blackbeard&#39;s castle.&nbsp; They 
				wanted $14 each to see the castle so instead we decided to do 
				more stairs.&nbsp; We went down 120, then across the valley, and 
				then up 125 and then down another 122, before heading back to 
				the boat.&nbsp; We were tuckered out by then.&nbsp; We did see 
				the same hotel we stayed at 5 years ago when we charted a 
				sailboat out of the BVIs.<br />
				<br />
				There are lots of boats here, and lots of toys, but the coolest 
				toy was this guy with water jet boots.&nbsp; He would soar at 
				least 30 feet into the air, and then move around.&nbsp; He would 
				dive into the water from a height of about 10 feet and like a 
				porpoise would shoot out again straight up into the air.&nbsp; 
				It was really fun to watch.<br />
				<br />
				Of course we had to do a little more engine work, as our new 
				starter arrived while in St. Thomas, and for once the job was 
				fairly simple and straightforward - and surprise - surprise, 
				everything worked first time out.&nbsp; We must be losing our 
				touch.<br />
				<br />
				After St. Thomas, we headed 37 miles south to the island of St. 
				Croix.&nbsp; St. Croix isn&#39;t on the usual cruiser stop because 
				it is a 70 mile round trip out of the way place.&nbsp; So of 
				course, we had to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; The island was a Danish 
				military presence at one time, and the Danish influence was 
				prominent in the architecture which made the town of 
				Christenstead very pretty, and yellow painted buildings 
				everywhere.<br />
				<br />
				We went out to Buck Island, which is a national park.&nbsp; At 
				one time it was rated on of the 10 best beaches in the world by 
				National Geographic.&nbsp; It was a nice beach, and the sand was 
				fine and soft.&nbsp; We snorkeled in the area, and saw a couple 
				of squid, which was first for us.&nbsp; A lot of coral in the 
				area was badly damaged by a hurricane in the past, and it is 
				making a slow comeback.<br />
				<br />
				After St. Croix, we sailed another 35 miles to St. John.&nbsp; 
				We are in a nice calm anchorage here, and went snorkeling today 
				and saw two Hawksbill Sea turtles.&nbsp; They were not afraid of 
				us at all, and it was really neat to glide around in the water 
				next to them.<br />
				<br />
				We will visit some more places here on St. John, then onto the 
				British Virgin Islands - God save the Queen!<br />

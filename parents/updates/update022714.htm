      It is easy to get comfortable at dock or at anchor and when you start to
      think about making a passage it becomes a bit of a push.&nbsp; We had been
      travel from island to island for the last month during the day with no
      overnight trips.&nbsp; Even coming up from Grenada we only had a couple of
      single overnight passages.&nbsp; The trip from Fajardo Puerto Rico to
      Georgetown Bahamas looked to be a 5 day trip, not a major trip compared to
      crossing the Pacific but one that you needed to mentally ready for.<br />
      <br />
      During the week of Feb 17th we watched the weather to see the best 5 day
      block of winds and waves.&nbsp; Watching the weather it looked like Monday
      the 24th would be the best day to take off but as the week went by Sat the
      22nd became the most favorable.<br />
      <br />
      We knew the seas and winds would be stronger to begin with but we knew
      they would become lighter as the week progressed.&nbsp; When we took off
      we had winds of 20 to 25 knots and seas of 6 to 9 feet but all from behind
      us.&nbsp; The boat really liked the conditions, we saw 7 to 10 knots with
      a single reefed main.&nbsp; As the days continued the winds and seas
      became less and less and by the end of the 3rd day we had to turn on an
      engine to maintain 4 knots of boat speed.&nbsp; The last part of the trip
      from Long Island to Georgetown was into the wind so we motored that as
      well.<br />
      <br />
      During the trip we broke the shifts into 4 hour blocks between Dean and
      Kris.&nbsp; We kept Derek in reserve to take over if either one of us
      needed a break, or wasn&#39;t getting enough sleep.&nbsp; If you were on
      &quot;watch&quot; you looked for ships or other things to avoid usually by
      sitting at the wheel.&nbsp; During your watch you usually read during the
      day and did a lot of star gazing during the night.&nbsp; If you were off
      watch then you were sleeping or eating, usually sleeping.&nbsp; Derek did
      not have much to do, so ended up&nbsp; watching two seasons of the TV show
      &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; that we had on disc.&nbsp; During the trip
      Kris saw 4 boats and had to take action to avoid two of them hitting us
      and Dean only saw 2 lights on the horizon but nothing close by.<br />
      <br />
      A few people were watching our progress on the SPOT track to make sure we
      were actually moving and making sure we were O.K.&nbsp; Overall the
      passage was easy and we pulled into the anchorage somewhat rested and
      ready for the next adventure. <br />
      <br />
      Sam did not enjoy the first two days, but after that, he got used to it,
      or got so tired he couldn&#39;t stay awake any longer, and finally slept,
      ate and relaxed, and of course took his trips to the net for relief.

      Well, we had a great sail from St. Martin/Sint Maarten to the Virgin Gorda
      Sound in the British Virgins Islands (BVI&#39;s).&nbsp; We sailed dead
      downwind with a reef in the main, and made 6 knots most all the
      trip.&nbsp; We finally turned on the motor for the last 17 miles.&nbsp; We
      thought we would have to motor more, but we were enjoying the sail and did
      not want to motor, but since we were almost out of water, we powered up
      and made water for three hours.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We were anxious to see how the boat fared after our big repair job, and
      especially looking for and movement on the hull and listening for creaking
      sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; The boat was the quietest it has ever been, with only
      one creaky noise coming from some wood trim which is easily
      fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;Virgin Gorda sound is a large area, and lots of mega-yachts and
      charter boats.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is fun to watch the charter boats come in
      and anchor, and that will probably our continuing entertainment as long as
      we are in the BVI&#39;s.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Derek met up with a friend that he played with briefly back in Hog Island,
      Nate on Kula Kai and him have been having fun playing on the beach, knee
      boarding and just hanging out.<br />
      <br />
      We went snorkeling today out in Eustatia sound, and were
      disappointed.&nbsp; On the outer reef we did see a couple of cannons, but
      other than that the coral was mostly dead, bleached and broken all over
      the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; We tried a few other spots, and finally found one
      spot that had some nice live soft corals and fish, but definitely not a
      high ranking snorkel spot.<br />
      <br />
      We walked the town the other day.&nbsp; Virgin Gorda has a famous sailor
      place called the Bitter End Yacht Club.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is well known in
      sailing circles.&nbsp; Our friends on Pollux described it as the
      Disneyland of the Caribbean and they are right.&nbsp; It is all fancied up
      to appeal to the one week charter guests and mega yachties.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
      doesn&#39;t really have a strong appeal for most cruisers and the
      restaurants and meager stores seemed overpriced.<br />
      <br />
      After Virgin Gorda we left for the main town called Road Town on the large
      island of Tortola.&nbsp; We have been here before, and knew where the
      stores were for provisioning.&nbsp; The grocery store here is almost like
      walking into one back in the states.&nbsp; It took a couple of trips to
      stock up and hike back the 1/4 mile with the groceries.&nbsp; The harbor
      we anchor in is a base for the Moorings and Sunsail charter fleets, but it
      is also quite dirty. <br />
      <br />
      Not to be boat bound, Derek headed over in his Kayak to check out a
      mangrove island in the small bay.&nbsp; He made quite the finds, and
      convinced his Dad to go back with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; We figure during strong
      winds, all the items that have not been properly tied down on the charter
      boats blows right into the mangroves and then sits there waiting for
      someone like Derek to find.&nbsp; So far - three fenders, one small yellow
      paddle board and two nice foam seats he has pulled out and Dean and Derek
      cleaned up.&nbsp; We didn&#39;t have much time, but plan on going back and
      putting our full scrounge on to see what we can find.<br />
      <br />
      After the shopping was done, we headed over to Norman Island for a few
      nights.&nbsp; Our friends on Pollux had guests come in, so they joined us
      and we spent a few nights there.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Derek has gotten into knee boarding, or wake boarding, no sure which to
      call it, but he takes his board and gets towed behind the
      dinghy.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is getting pretty good at it, and is now trying
      tricks like a 360 spin.&nbsp;

      As we pulled into Georgetown on Thursday the cruiser&#39;s net on the VHF
      was just starting so we were quickly introduced to what was going on at
      this anchorage.&nbsp; This happened to be the week of the Cruiser&#39;s
      Regatta so they have had a lot going on.&nbsp; Derek has been able to
      participate that day in the kids activity and then even got into the adult
      bocce ball competition on Friday.<br />
      <br />
      Sam really enjoyed being able to walk on something that does not move,
      roll in the sand and even play with a couple other dogs.&nbsp; Sam did
      well on the passage, he hates the noise of the electric winch and if we
      did anything with the sails he would usually go inside and try and find
      his quiet spot.&nbsp; Once a day we would take him up to the bow net and
      he would do his business and then go back inside.&nbsp; By the end of the
      trip he made a few trips to the bow with out anyone encouraging him.<br />
      <br />
      We thought the boat &quot;Good Trade&quot; might still be at Georgetown
      and sure enough they were and we found a spot next to them to
      anchor.&nbsp; We had buddy boated with them last year until the BVI&#39;s
      and so it was good to catch up with them again.&nbsp; It looks like the
      next couple of months our plans look the same as theirs so we probably
      will buddy boat again with them.<br />
      <br />
      There are a couple of Manta 42s here as well, &quot;Dues Paid&quot; and
      &quot;Sangaris&quot;, and it is always good to see other Mantas out and
      about.<br />
      <br />
      After traveling the Eastern Caribbean Islands you get use to checking into
      the country and then checking out as you moved to a different
      island.&nbsp; When we checked into the US Virgin island we went into the
      office, filled out the paper work, no issues.&nbsp; When we checked into
      Puerto Rico we were able to do it via the phone, no issues.&nbsp; When we
      checked into the Bahamas we were out of the routine a bit, or they had a
      slightly different process, so we spent a bit more time on Thursday
      checking it.&nbsp; In the end we were cleared and so now have the next 90
      days of being able to cruise the Bahamas. <br />
      <br />
      It is taking a couple of days/nights to get back into the normal time
      frame of being awake all day and going to bed in the evening.&nbsp; Having
      the boat not rocking/rolling does help with going to sleep.<br />

				To some life on the boat might seem a bit slow but there are 
				some issues that take a bit more time and focus.&nbsp; Like the 
				issue of do we sail down to Trinidad and Tobago or not?&nbsp; 
				That seems like a simple question but you need to understand the 
				issues around it to fully appreciate the problem.<br />
				<br />
				We have always looked to head to Trinidad if there was a 
				hurricane that came close to Grenada.&nbsp; The number of 
				hurricanes that have gone thru Trinidad are zero so it makes a 
				spot to go if there is a hurricane.&nbsp; The negative of 
				staying in Trinidad is it is HOT.... HOT.....HOT.&nbsp; At least 
				that is what we have heard.&nbsp; The water in the Trinidad area 
				is not pleasant so jumping in to the water to cool off is just 
				not an option.&nbsp; The other issue is for Sam, by Trinidad 
				law, he would have to be quarantined for six months.&nbsp; 
				Several cruisers will keep their pets on board so they do not 
				have to worry about it.&nbsp; And we have heard other cruisers 
				that take the dog and just walk them in the marina, or on a 
				deserted beach in the morning, and have had no issues, but 
				technically, it is against the law.<br />
				<br />
				With that why would we consider even going?&nbsp; Well the 
				information that we have heard is the food, fuel, and work/labor 
				is cheaper there than anywhere else.&nbsp; Since we are looking 
				to resupply our food inventory we thought that going to Trinidad 
				might be just the ticket.&nbsp; The boat does not need any major 
				work so the need for work/labor is not needed.&nbsp; To deal 
				with the hotness of the area we would go to a marina and hook up 
				the AC on the boat and would stay somewhat comfortable.&nbsp; 
				The issue there, is that the only work the boat does need, is 
				one A/C unit is not working.&nbsp; We have one that does, but 
				one doesn&#39;t, so if we went to Trinidad to the dock with power, 
				then we should fix the other unit, but if we don&#39;t go, we don&#39;t 
				need the A/C and don&#39;t have to fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other 
				issue would still be how do we keep Sam happy and walked.<br />
				<br />
				To top those issues we also had another boat that was going to 
				meet us there.&nbsp; The sail down to Trinidad is 90 miles so a 
				day/night trip would be needed.&nbsp; It would be nice to see 
				the other boat and spend some time exploring the area, we could 
				also go out to Tobago Island if we were in the area.<br />
				<br />
				Thus our dilemma, go to Trinidad or not.<br />
				<br />
				End result: we stayed in Grenada</div>

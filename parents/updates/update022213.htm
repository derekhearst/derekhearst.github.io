      After many attempts we finally pulled into Mayaguez Puerto Rico on Sunday
      2/17/13 and dropped anchor.&nbsp; The passage from the Dominican Republic
      across the Mona Passage was ok, confused seas but the winds were under 15
      and we made good time.&nbsp; We pulled into the anchorage at midnight on
      Sunday and had a good night sleep.<br />
      <br />
      Monday morning bright and early we headed into shore to check in with
      customs.&nbsp; Well another good plan but it was President&#39;s Day and
      everything with the government was closed.&nbsp; No problem we had a
      telephone number to call and check in, however finding a pay phone now a
      days is rather difficult.&nbsp; That&#39;s ok we found an open gas station
      and they allowed us to use their phone.&nbsp; After being on hold for too
      many minutes we hung up and tried to figure out what to do.<br />
      <br />
      Along comes George, a local businessman who wanted to help us.&nbsp; Ross
      and Dean got into his car and he took them to the customs/immigration
      office and after talking with the guard had another phone number to
      use.&nbsp; George being a helpful person offered the use of his phone,
      that proved to make it a long day for him.&nbsp; The number was called,
      another number given and finally contact was made.&nbsp; Over the next
      three hours we hung out with George, had lunch, toured Mayaguez and saw
      the sights.&nbsp; Since George&#39;s phone number was the contact number
      he had to stay with us until all the communication had been completed.<br />
      <br />
      So at the end of all the phone calls we still had to come back into the
      office on Tuesday and see an official.&nbsp; When we talked to him on
      Tuesday he said why are you here you should have just used the
      phone.&nbsp; An hour or so later we finally had officially checked in and
      moved the boat south to Boquerón.&nbsp; &quot;Good Trade&quot; had company
      coming in to meet them at Boquerón and since it was a better anchorage we
      stayed there two nights.&nbsp; The company was staying at a local hotel
      and so everyone spent one day around the pool and then onto the boat.<br />
      <br />
      Today we are at La Parguera and we will continue onto to Ponce where
      &quot;Good Trade&#39;s&quot; company will leave on Monday.&nbsp; The water
      is warmer but not as clear yet as we hoped it would be.&nbsp; Derek went
      out to snorkel on the reefs, Kris went into the town and Dean puttered
      around the boat.

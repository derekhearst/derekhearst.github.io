      Well Christmas has come and gone.&nbsp; We wanted to get this out before
      Christmas, but we are slow - what can we say? <br />
      <br />
      This year has been a year of extremes, snow and cool weather at the start
      of the year and now sun and temperatures in the mid 70s to lower
      80&#39;s.&nbsp; Living in a 3000 sq ft house and now maybe 300 sq ft
      boat.&nbsp; Working hard at Bigelow and now working hard at staying out of
      trouble.<br />
      <br />
      The boat has been worked on while it was at Bridgeport on the hard, when
      it was in the water at Bridgeport, while we traveled down the coast, and
      we are just about done with most of the work list.&nbsp; Of course we tend
      to add more projects but once we leave Florida there will be less parts
      available so the projects might just add up.<br />
      <br />
      Derek graduated from the 5th grade and was headed to middle school in
      Trumbull which was just behind our house.&nbsp; Now he is lives in the
      school and has to deal with two teachers/parents who might focus a bit
      more on his effort vs. personality.&nbsp; The home schooling has been
      going well and it has been nice to be able to focus more or less on
      subjects based upon how Derek is learning vs. how the rest of the class is
      doing.<br />
      <br />
      We did have an exciting cross country trip in the Jeep, left Trumbull CT
      on a Friday night and arrived in Boise Idaho four days later.&nbsp; The
      family, two dogs, one cat, Derek, Dean and Kris were all happy to get out
      of the vehicle and walk vs. just sit.&nbsp; We were able to meet up with
      many family and friends and see a lot of the country side prior to selling
      the jeep and jumping on the boat.<br />
      <br />
      Once on the boat we took a quick trip north to Block Island and then it
      has been head south, warmer weather being the main focus.&nbsp; We did get
      to experience our first hurricane - Irene.&nbsp; The impact of it was very
      minor for us and really did not disrupt our schedule or cause an
      issue.&nbsp; Our schedule has been very vague at best so we must be on
      schedule.<br />
      <br />
      We were not sure where we might end up, Bahamas or Virgin Islands, it
      looks like this year will be the Bahamas.&nbsp; Several cruisers have been
      exploring the Bahamas for ten plus years and say they have yet to see all
      the anchorages.&nbsp;

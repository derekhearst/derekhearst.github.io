				Since we are in Cocoa Florida it is on proper we give &quot;I Dream 
				of Jeannie&quot; it&#39;s justice of recognizing the importance of that 
				show, ok that might be a bit of a push but we are 
				close to Cocoa Beach.&nbsp; In the show Jeannie, Major Nelson, and Major 
				Healey kept the space program in everyone&#39;s mind and anything 
				was possible with just a nod from Jeannie.&nbsp; Well we have 
				not seen any of the cast but we did get to see the launch of 
				the Curiosity Rover to Mars.&nbsp; The launch occurred at 10:03 on 
				Saturday and we watched it from Dean&#39;s cousin&#39;s place.&nbsp;The 
				Rover will circle Earth for the next 7 months and then off to 
				Mars, another 8.5 months to get there.&nbsp; Once the Rover 
				lands it will have power to roam over the planet for at least 
				two years.
				<br />
				<br />
				Dean&#39;s cousin Linda and her husband Phil entertained us like 
				royalty.&nbsp; They cooked Thanksgiving dinner, had us over for&nbsp; breakfast and watching the 
				launch from their place. They took us to the Black Point Wildlife 
				Drive where we spotted our first live in the wild gaiters.&nbsp; 
				Derek and Dean&nbsp; 
				played Wii golf with Phil, and finally they had us over for 
				dinner again on Tuesday.&nbsp; We even flooded 
				their mail box with a bunch of packages, we had used their 
				address to receive several packages.&nbsp; Most of our relatives 
				are on the west coast so having someone on the east coast was 
				extra nice. Linda made some of the best brownies and chocolate 
				chip cookies we have ever had.<br />
				<br />
				The park at Cocoa has this cool fountain and Derek played one 
				afternoon in it.&nbsp; Well he started off playing around the 
				jets of water but by the end of the day he was in the water more 
				than out of the water.&nbsp; The dingy ride back to the boat was 
				wet due to the wind and surf but Derek was already soaked so he 
				didn&#39;t care.&nbsp; There are many small shops in the town, 
				officially Cocoa Village and one is a magic shop that Derek 
				spent some time and money at.&nbsp; Sooner or later we should be able to 
				put Derek on the street corner and he can entertain for money :).<br />
				<br />
				Of course the time here was not all fun, Kris was forced to go 
				into the biggest and most awesome hardware store ever!!!!&nbsp; 
				The store was founded in 1885 and covers several buildings, not 
				sure how many square feet - but a lot.&nbsp; If your local Home 
				Depot or Lowes does not have an item they send the customer to 
				this store.&nbsp; 
				You can walk through the aisles but if you want to find something 
				specific you are ahead to ask because you will not find it unless you 
				have a guide, it is that loaded with stuff.&nbsp; The first time 
				Derek and Kris went into the store it was an hour before they 
				immerged with the look of wow on their faces.&nbsp; Thus we have 
				purchased a few items that we have been looking for and so a 
				couple more projects are closer to being done.</div>

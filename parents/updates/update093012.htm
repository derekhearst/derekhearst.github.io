				Well the time the boat spent on the land is over and we are very 
				happy to be back in the water.&nbsp; The projects are completed, 
				of course we added a few to the list. We did not have any 
				&quot;major&quot; projects but by the end of each day we were rather tired 
				and had a few sore muscles.&nbsp; We are running a test this 
				year, there are many thoughts about how to keep the propellors 
				clean; different types of paints, doing nothing, even using a 
				sharpie pen.&nbsp; So we did one prop with epaint and the second 
				prop Kris covered with the black sharpie pen.&nbsp; Now we can 
				compare side by side and see if one keeps the barnacles off 
				better than the other one.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Keeping the boat clean while in the water is a challenge but 
				while on land it was just about impossible. The blue tarp kept 
				the sanded bottom paint from going into the soil and getting 
				into the water table but allowed us to walk through it daily, 
				even the dogs were able to have green paws.&nbsp; Some of those 
				paw &amp; foot prints eventually made it onto the boat.&nbsp; There 
				was also a boat beside us doing some sanding and the road to the 
				boat yard was off our back step.&nbsp; All in all - we had a bit 
				of filth on the boat after a week.&nbsp; With the blue tarp 
				below us we could not just hose off the boat so some buckets and 
				sponges were used but not a great cleaning could be done.<br />
				<br />
				We were able to get the boat moved to the water and while we 
				waited for the tide to come in we had a water hose available and 
				had a major cleaning event.&nbsp; We cleaned the boat inside and 
				out, and gave the dogs a bath.&nbsp; The dogs also are enjoying 
				not being lifted on and off the boat. While on land Dean had to 
				carry them up the ladder to the swim platform which is there 
				normal spot for getting on and off the boat.<br />
				<br />
				The boat yard has lots of activity of the commercial watermen 
				working on their fishing/clamming/oyster boats.&nbsp; The boats 
				have a design that is a Chesapeake design and most are wooden.&nbsp; 
				The two guys running the Holiday Marina boat yard, Dan and 
				Richard, try and keep everyone supplied with materials and 
				moving the boats in and out of the water.<br />
				<br />
				&quot;What If&quot;&nbsp; was put in the water around 6 pm and after 
				taking on fuel we headed out.&nbsp; We wanted to get to 
				Annapolis, Maryland early so we could find a anchoring spot and 
				with the boat show on Oct 4-7 space was going to be tight.&nbsp; 
				There was a full moon out and 10 knots of wind behind us so we 
				had a good motor/sail up the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp; After 22 
				hours we made it to Back Creek,&nbsp; anchored, and took a long 
				deserved break.<br />
				<br />
				While the boat was out of the water our schedule was a bit 
				hectic but now we should be able to get back into a routine.&nbsp; 
				For instance our schooling time did not always happen so we have 
				a couple of make up days -&nbsp; Derek is not looking forward to 
				that.<br />

      It has already been a month since we landed in Grenada, sure does not seem
      like it.&nbsp; As with anywhere it is easy to get into a routine and the
      days just fly by.&nbsp; We thought you might enjoy how our days fly by, if
      not sorry for the following update.<br />
      <br />
      Sun rise is currently 5:52 am and the boat is bright and sleep is hard to
      come by.&nbsp; That does not mean that we get up at that time but sleep is
      something that you have to work at by that time.&nbsp; To be nice to
      others usually you head outside and sit in the cockpit and view the other
      boats and have breakfast.<br />
      <br />
      Now breakfast on our boat varies from toasted wheat bread with lemon tea
      to Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal to white bread with nutella and
      yogurt.&nbsp; It is up to the individual what they want for breakfast and
      it is a fix it yourself type of meal.<br />
      <br />
      At 7:30 the local VHF cruiser net comes on the radio and that lasts for
      1/2 to 1 hour depending upon how long people talk.&nbsp; The net gives the
      latest weather and information on any hurricanes, any social activities
      that are going on either by the locals or other cruisers, and then
      parts/services/items of the bilge to be sold by other cruisers.&nbsp; One
      of the services provided by the local businesses it the &quot;Shopping
      Bus&quot;.&nbsp; On Tuesday and Friday there are buses that go to the
      marinas where cruisers can board them and ride to the local grocery
      stores.&nbsp; They cost $10 EC, about $3.50 US, for the ride to and from
      the store.&nbsp; Usually one bus, it really is just a van, full of 15
      cruisers to the store requires two bus trips on the return trip due to the
      extra shopping bags.<br />
      <br />
      Around 8:15 Kris is jumping into the water for water aerobics, or
      noodleing as it is called here.&nbsp; You use a swimming noodle to help
      you float in the water and then do water exercise.&nbsp; The class is an
      hour in length and has 6 to 12 folks participating in it.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Dean usually drops Kris off and then takes Sam for his morning walk.&nbsp;
      There are several roads/paths that are available for the walk and
      depending upon how warm/humid it is the length is subject to change.&nbsp;
      There are several other dogs on boats and usually one or two of them are
      encountered during the walk.&nbsp; By the time Sam gets back to the boat
      he is ready for his morning/afternoon nap.<br />
      <br />
      As this is going on Derek has been hard work at school.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris
      has laid out a daily school schedule and Derek has working on it and is
      eagerly awaiting the teachers to return and help him on his next
      subject.&nbsp; OK maybe eager is too strong but Derek is happy when Dean
      and Kris get back to the boat to help him with school.<br />
      <br />
      By this time it is lunch and Kris makes sandwiches or heats up leftovers
      for our dining pleasure.&nbsp; After lunch, Derek usually heads to the
      beach with other kids, or they hang out at the boat swimming and jumping
      off the radar arch, or inventing other swimming games around the
      boat.&nbsp; Dean and Kris may do some laundry, work on a boat project, do
      computer work, play a game, or just relax and read a book.&nbsp; Kris
      usually finds time for a quick nap after lunch, and sometimes Dean is
      caught napping as well.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Around 5:00 Derek comes home, Dean prepares dinner and we have time to
      talk as a family.&nbsp; We usually watch a movie, or TV show and relax in
      the evening.&nbsp; Derek likes to play on the computer, and Kris and Dean
      read or play computer games or just like to sit and watch the boats as the
      sun sets. <br />

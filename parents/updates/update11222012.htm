      Kris&#39;s folks, Norm and Deedy Whittington,&nbsp; decided to drive from
      Bend, Oregon to Stuart, FL to visit us.&nbsp; That is a trip of about
      3,000&nbsp; miles ONE WAY.&nbsp; They have a pickup with camper, so they
      loaded up the cat and took off.&nbsp; That&#39;s right, our cat Sackett,
      who they have adopted while we are sailing, came with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
      was nice to see Sackett again, as we had him for 11 years before
      Kris&#39;s folks agreed to adopt him while we sailed.&nbsp; They have
      thoroughly spoiled him rotten, and now we are not sure we will ever get
      him back, as he quite enjoys his new home.<br />
      <br />
      Norm and Deedy also brought something very near and dear to our hearts -
      yes Tillamook Cheese - about 40 pounds of cheese.&nbsp; Yes that is right
      40 lbs - you got a problem with that????<br />
      Most of you know that we like cheese, and Tillamook cheese is simply the
      best cheese there is.&nbsp; You can unfortunately only get it mostly on
      the west coast, so Kris&#39;s folks were nice enough to purchase some and
      bring it out with them.&nbsp; Otherwise, we would have had them ship
      it!!<br />
      <br />
      We spent a nice 5 days with them, did a lot of shopping and provisioning,
      and it was great to have a vehicle to do stuff in.&nbsp; We would not have
      been able to accomplish all the provisioning we did without
      them.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were also fortunate enough to hook up with our
      friends on &quot;Good Trade&quot;, and we all went out for dinner
      together.&nbsp; &quot;Good Trade&quot; is also from Bend, Oregon, so&nbsp;
      we all had a lot in common.<br />
      <br />
      Norm and Deedy&nbsp; went for&nbsp; scenic motor with Kris and Derek down
      the ICW between Stuart and Lake Worth.&nbsp; Dean drove the camper down so
      they could have the boat trip.&nbsp; We wish we could have had more time
      with them, but they were concerned about weather on the way back home, so
      they headed out, and made it back in time for Thanksgiving in Oregon.<br />
      <br />
      After they left, we headed further south, as the weather has been
      unseasonably cold, and Kris was needing more warmth.&nbsp; We took a
      chance on the weather and left port at 4:30 a.m. to make a 75 mile run
      down to Miami.&nbsp; The forecast was for 3 to 5 foot seas, but we did not
      see anything near 5 feet, maybe 3 feet at the maximum which was
      nice.&nbsp; We had to stay less than one mile from shore because the gulf
      stream was so close to land that unless we did we had a knot or more
      current against us.&nbsp; By staying close to shore, we picked up a small
      counter current and made the trip with no issues.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We did have a small visitor on the way - a lonely honey bee, who was cold
      and tired.&nbsp; Kris put out a small lid with some honey on it, which he
      readily went to and ate his fill.&nbsp; It was amazing how active he got
      once he had some nourishment, and he quickly flew off after that.<br />
      <br />
      We are here in Miami Beach now, with free city provided internet, so Derek
      is thrilled.&nbsp; Lots of shopping close by, and a reasonably calm
      anchorage.&nbsp; We will hang out here until we get a good weather window
      for the Bahamas and then we will head out.

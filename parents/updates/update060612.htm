        >Our time in the Bahamas has been spent in the three major island
        groups, Exumas, Eleuthera and Abaco.&nbsp; The least amount of time we
        spent in any group was the Abacos and that was due to weather and timing
        the crossing back into the states.&nbsp; We sailed into the southern end
        of Abaco and worked our way through quiet anchorages and then into Marsh
        Harbor which is the third largest city in the Bahamas.<br />
        <br />
        The weather had turned&nbsp; rainy, windy, and cloudy so each anchorage
        was not as easy to explore and enjoy.&nbsp; Several days we were
        &quot;stuck&quot; on the boat waiting for weather to clear so we could
        get into shore with out a major soaking by the rain storms.&nbsp; This
        year was the first since the early 1900&#39;s that two major tropical
        depressions were named before June, and those affected the weather quiet
        a bit. <br />
        <br />
        When we arrived in Marsh Harbor the talk of the cruisers was you will
        not believe how incredible the grocery store &quot;Maxwell&quot;
        is.&nbsp; Most of the stores we have been in are OK but the stock is
        limited and sometimes the weekly mail boats do not bring everything to
        restock the shelves so you just deal with it.&nbsp; So when we got to
        Maxwells we were surprised to find it rivaling some of the U.S. stores
        for variety and volume.&nbsp; This was a very pleasant find and our
        supplies grew as we got some items we had just gone without for the last
        5 months.<br />
        <br />
        Typically people will leave out of the Abacos and head back to the
        states, either by a day trip into Florida or much longer passages to
        head further north.&nbsp; One boat we knew went to Bermuda and then up
        to Rhode Island, each leg of the trip is 5 to 7 days.&nbsp; We decided
        to take the 3 day/3night trip to Charleston S.C. and another catamaran
        &quot;Good Trade&quot; also left at the same time.&nbsp; During a
        several day trip it is nice to be able to talk to another boat and see
        how their seas and winds are doing -&nbsp; you know - misery loves
        company.&nbsp; <br />
        <br />
        The trip started out with very light winds and 2 foot seas.&nbsp; The
        wind picked up and so did the seas but both were out of the SW so it was
        behind us/on our beam, not a bad direction.&nbsp; As the trip continued
        the winds clocked to the West and then back to the South so we were able
        to use all of our sails aboard.&nbsp; In the end we made better time
        than we had planned, the majority of the trip we averaged 7.1 knots, had
        been planning on 5.5 knots, so the boat did great.&nbsp; The crew also
        did ok, the first few days it took some getting use to the 3 hours on
        and 3 hours off but by the end your sleep and eating pattern had
        adapted.<br />
        <br />
        We had planned on arriving in Charleston during the day light but with
        the faster times we made port at midnight.&nbsp; Coming in during the
        night is never a good idea, but &quot;Good Trade&quot; had saved a track
        on thier chartplotter to an anchorage just inside the entrance to the
        harbor, so we felt safe following them.&nbsp; We only had a couple major
        container ships coming out and one barge/tow boat to worry about.&nbsp;
        When we dropped anchor at 2 am and finally fell asleep it was a very
        restful sleep.<br />
        <br />
        We spent three nights at a dock in Charleston, and thoroughly scrubbed
        the boat with unlimited free water.&nbsp; Kris did 9 loads of laundry
        and washed every bit of fabric she could find.<br />
        <br />
        We will hang here for a few weeks.&nbsp; Our friends Bob and Anne on
        &quot;Baloo&quot; should arrive, and we will head north again.</span

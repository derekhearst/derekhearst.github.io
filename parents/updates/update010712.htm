      The water is absolutely amazing, blue, clear and in the mid 70s.&nbsp; You
      can see the bottom go by as you are sailing -&nbsp; it is a bit unnerving
      even though it is still 30 to 50 feet deep.&nbsp; There are soooo many
      shades of blue as well - from the light blue shallow sandy areas to the
      deep dark blues of the deep areas.&nbsp; We do not have air tanks so
      snorkeling has been our thing but since you can see so deep I am not sure
      we have missed out on much.&nbsp; Yesterday we were able to snorkel in 10
      feet of water with nursing sharks, rays, and fish (not too bad for the
      first week in January).<br />
      <br />
      Our first port of call in the Bahamas was Alice Town in North Bimini where
      we cleared customs, immigration and raised our Bahamas flag.&nbsp; The
      crossing from Florida to the Bahamas is always iffy but we had a great day
      of sailing and the seas were somewhat calm.&nbsp; From there we made a
      short stop at New Providence west end and then it was onto &quot;Iguana
      land&quot; at Allen Cay in the Exumas.&nbsp; (all the &quot;Cays&quot; are
      pronounced &quot;Key&quot;)&nbsp; We anchored in 10 feet of sandy bottom,
      a bit of a current but overall very nice.&nbsp; There was some bad weather
      the next few days so we thought this would be a great spot to spend time
      walking around the island and spying on the iguanas, it is a natural
      refuge for iguanas so there were many running around.&nbsp; There were
      several other boaters in the anchorage and one girl had her 2nd
      birthday.&nbsp; That required a beach party, a scavenger hunt, and a
      history lesson in French.&nbsp; The family is from France so they had made
      a list of trivia questions for all the beach goers to answer, before you
      got any food.<br />
      <br />
      We now have made a huge leap of 5 miles to Highborne Cay and are anchored
      in 15 feet of clear blue water.&nbsp; We found wifi at the anchorage so
      are jumping at the chance to catch up on emails and websites.&nbsp; Kris
      found out here Aunt Bev passed away on Monday so having the internet is
      helpful.&nbsp; Derek and Kris did take a walk and found that if they
      waited at the bus stop it might be awhile, at least it was for the other
      guy.&nbsp; On the way back they were very thirsty and were excited to see
      the signs for a spring.&nbsp; Well the only spring they found was a rusted
      one hanging from a tree - people on this island have a&nbsp; good sense of
      humor.

      The morning of 6/30/12 found Kris at the wheel and the boat moving at 3 to
      4 knots, we only had 8 to 10 knots of winds.&nbsp; When we say morning, we
      mean 12:01, just after midnight.&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      We left Norfolk, VA on June 28th and headed north with light winds -
      sailed all day and all night and all day the 29th, pleasant sailing, slow
      but gentle seas.&nbsp; Then it all changed.&nbsp; Dean had just gone off
      watch, and Kris came on at midnight.&nbsp; Some lightning developed
      towards shore and the winds built.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Kris got Dean up and we lowered the spinnaker.&nbsp; The winds were about
      16 knots, so we put up the jib and were moving about 3.5 knots boat
      speed.<br />
      The lightning got worse, and closer, so all hatches were closed, and the
      wind built to 20 knots.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We normally can run with just
      our jib up to 35 to 40 knots.<br />
      <br />
      Dean seeing and hearing the lightning, got up - and then it
      hit.&nbsp;&nbsp; It went from 20 knots to 50 to 60 knots within
      minutes.&nbsp; Not enough time to get the jib down, and it wasn&#39;t safe
      to go forward to wrestle it.<br />
      The lightning was all around us, sheet lightning, bead lightning, ribbon
      lightning and strike lightning.&nbsp; So much lightning, it was like being
      in a room with a strobe light.<br />
      <br />
      The winds blew&nbsp; for about an hour at 50 to 60 knots, with some gusts
      over 60 knots.&nbsp; The seas went from 2 feet to 10 feet in a matter of
      minutes.<br />
      For the second hour the winds were 35 to 50 knots, and the third hour they
      dropped down to about 25 knots.&nbsp; By the 4th hour, the seas were down
      to 3 to 4 feet, and the winds around 20.&nbsp; lt&nbsp; was all we could
      do was make sure we headed out to sea, and not to shore.&nbsp; The jib was
      still up, but not for long - the halyard parted and it came down, which
      was better, as it was not flogging around anymore.<br />
      <br />
      We listened to the VHF radio, and the Coast Guard was kept busy with
      several emergency calls.&nbsp; We, luckily were not one of them.<br />
      <br />
      This morning, we surveyed the damage, and found several small seams had
      ripped in the jib, and the camber spar for our jib, which is a 2&quot;
      diameter aluminum tube, was quite bent.&nbsp; We will have to replace the
      camber spar (can&#39;t be fixed), sew the jib seams, and somehow feed a
      new jib halyard line, which we hope will not be too hard.&nbsp; There is
      also some damage at the top of the mast, but we haven&#39;t gone up yet to
      check it out.<br />
      <br />
      This is the second time this month we have had hurricane force winds, with
      no hurricane.&nbsp; If we had a choice, we would never experience that
      again.&nbsp; Now we are sitting here at anchor in Atlantic Highlands, N.J.
      with it all behind us - except for the repairs of course.

      Last year we were at Washington DC viewing the museums and monuments
      during the famous Annapolis boat showboat but this year we were in
      Annapolis MD for it.&nbsp; There are a couple boat shows that are really
      &quot;bucket list&quot; shows and this one is one of those.&nbsp; They
      break the boat show into two weeks, the first is for sail boats and the
      second week is for power boats. We only stayed for the sailboats.<br />
      <br />
      Since the show is very popular you need to get hotel reservations, marina
      reservations or find your anchor spot early or you might be sorry.&nbsp;
      We arrived a week early and anchored in Back Creek with lots of room and
      space around us.&nbsp; As the boat show came closer the creek filled up
      and by the pictures you can see many more boats came in.<br />
      <br />
      There were two new families on Manta catamarans out sailing this year that
      were at the boat show, Marce/Jack on <em>Escape Velocity</em> and
      Craig/Wendy/Maggie/Kate/Olivia on <em>Anything Goes</em>.&nbsp; Craig had
      a birthday and at his party we also met Wil/Jenny/Justine/Colin on
      <em>Full Monty</em>, a <br />
      47 foot catamaran.&nbsp; For once Derek had lots of kids to play with at a
      cruiser get together.&nbsp; Scott and Tina off&nbsp; Sangaris, a Manta 42
      that we met in the Bahamas, live in Annapolis and they also
      attended.&nbsp; It was good to catch up with Scott and Tina on their
      adventures over the summer and plans for the upcoming winter.<br />
      <br />
      Derek was thrilled to meet Colin off of <em>Full Monty</em>, as he is a
      Minecraft fan as well. (Minecraft is a computer game that Derek spends his
      free time playing).&nbsp; Colin came over to the boat after school two
      days in a row, and Derek and him played Minecraft for a couple of hours
      each day.<br />
      <br />
      We only had a few things to look at in the boat show but some how we spent
      the entire day there, Derek wished it had been a bit shorter.&nbsp; While
      there we viewed some new catamarans, not to buy but to get new ideas
      on.&nbsp; We did stop by the Manson Supreme Anchor booth and talk to the
      rep about how pleased we are with the anchor and he gave us three watch
      caps.&nbsp; The caps have come in handy with the recent cooler
      weather.&nbsp; We also stopped by the Parasailor booth, a new design of
      spinnaker that has a hangglider like wing built into the sail.&nbsp; Derek
      got a really nice shirt from them.&nbsp; All in all we could have spent
      another day walking the show but we had purchased what we needed so it was
      time to head south.<br />
      <br />
      Friday night there was a Manta get together at a local restaurant.&nbsp;
      We had seven different Manta owners in town and three boats were currently
      cruising.&nbsp; The Manta owners share a website where issues and
      questions can be talked about with other who have the same
      questions.&nbsp; It was good to put faces to some of the names and the
      dinner was rather good as well.<br />
      <br />
      On Saturday we hoisted anchor and headed south, we did not make it far
      because the winds and waves were beating us up so after only a couple of
      hours we pulled into a protected anchorage and spent the night.&nbsp; The
      next day we left again and made it down past the Potomac river.&nbsp; On
      Monday we sailed down to Deltaville and stopped to see our friends Bob and
      Anne off <em> Baloo</em>.<br />

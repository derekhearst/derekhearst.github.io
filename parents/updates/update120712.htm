				Well it is warm here at Miami Beach;&nbsp; we thought by now we 
				would be headed to the Bahamas,&nbsp; but the weather is just 
				not behaving.&nbsp; When you leave from Miami area you have to 
				cross the Gulf Stream to get to the Bahamas.&nbsp; That water in 
				the Gulf Stream is moving south to north at about 5 knots.&nbsp; 
				When the winds are out of the north going against the Gulf 
				Stream the waves start to build and have been in the 6 to 10 
				foot seas.&nbsp; This is something we really wanted to avoid so 
				we have been waiting for the winds to clock around to the 
				southerly direction.&nbsp; When that happens the waves go down 
				into the 0 to 2 foot seas, much nicer.&nbsp; So we sit and wait, 
				could be worse places to wait.<br />
				<br />
				We have anchored off the main shipping channel into Miami over 
				on the Miami Beach side.&nbsp; This allows use to watch the 
				cruise ships come in and out of the port.&nbsp; There are a lot 
				of cruise ships Every day it seems there are two to three new 
				ones at the dock, and most are rather large.&nbsp; We have spent 
				some time walking up and down the South Beach area.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				South Beach has a lot of personality and diversity.&nbsp; There 
				are distinct cultural groups here, with a large Latin influence.&nbsp; 
				It is&nbsp; rather fun to just people watch.&nbsp; We ate lunch 
				at a Cuban restaurant the other day for Kris&#39;s birthday.&nbsp; 
				It seems like you can find all types of food and stores 
				depending upon what you are looking for.&nbsp; There are several 
				large grocery stores here, so we have finished all our 
				provisioning, and are ready to go when the weather turns.<br />
				<br />
				There are several boats in this anchorage and we have heard 
				there are a lot more just south of us waiting for the same 
				weather window to head east.&nbsp; So far the first real good 
				opportunity looks to be on Monday/Tuesday, the 10th or 11th.<br />
				<br />
				We have all been doing good health wise, Derek lost another 
				tooth the other day, it came out after he ate some gooey candy.&nbsp; 
				We think only a couple more teeth to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will 
				have to take him to a dentist sooner or later, but he is voting 
				for the much much later option.<br />
				<br />
				We have met some new folks here, also cruisers waiting to head 
				over to the Bahamas as well, but none with kids.&nbsp; We 
				haven&#39;t seen many cruising kids this year, but hope that we can 
				meet up with more once in Georgetown Bahamas.<br />

      We are hanging out on the Eleuthera Island and started at Rock Sound then
      Palmetto and now at Governor&#39;s Harbor.<br />
      <br />
      Rock Sound is the largest city on the island but is not really a
      cruiser&#39;s spot.&nbsp; The harbor is very well protected and depending
      upon which side of the harbor you anchor on you can be protected from just
      about every direction of wind.&nbsp; The water depth is not great, it ok
      for a cat, so that might be one of the reasons more boats are not
      here.&nbsp; We walked through town and found another blue hole, there was
      a park around it.&nbsp; For the first time we saw grass in people&#39;s
      yards and even saw a mower cutting grass.&nbsp; There must be enough rain
      here to support it.<br />
      <br />
      The town of Palmetto Point is really two towns, north and south.&nbsp; The
      north town is on the ocean side and the south town is on the Bahamas Bank
      side.&nbsp; We walked over to the Ocean side to check out the
      &quot;pink&quot; sand beach.&nbsp; Pink would be an overstatement, but
      there definitely was a pinkish hue.<br />
      <br />
      Governors Harbour, was the former capital of Bahamas and has some nice
      homes overlooking the harbour.&nbsp; There is even a hill of 300 feet tall
      that can give you a good work out on your walk.&nbsp; While we were here
      there were two unique boats that came into the harbor.&nbsp; One is the
      old classic sailing ship while the second is not that classic.&nbsp; The
      second boat came from the Canary Island and had a 60 day passage by an 86
      year old man.&nbsp; Not sure I would want to be on that boat for 60 days,
      not many spots to get out of the sun or waves.&nbsp; It has four pontoons,
      that look to be made of fiberglass, with many cross members lashed to
      them.&nbsp; The cross members looked to be lashed on with trucking
      straps.&nbsp; Then there is the attractive sheet metal kwansit type hut
      for the cabin.&nbsp; Makes us feel like we are in a floating palace
      compared to them.&nbsp; Here is the web site talking about his voyage<br />

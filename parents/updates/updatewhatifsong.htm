      &nbsp;This song was composed and sung at Boise Idaho by Nancy B.<br />
      &quot;theme song from Gilligan&#39;s Island..... modified slightly
      :)&quot;<br />
      <br />
      Just sit right back<br />
      and you&#39;ll hear a tale<br />
      a tale of a well planned trip<br />
      that started from Connecticut<br />
      aboard a not so tiny ship.<br />
      The mate was a mighty sailin man,<br />
      the skipper brave and sure<br />
      five passengers set sail that day (including the 2 dogs)<br />
      for a three year tour<br />
      a three year tour<br />
      <br />
      The weather started getting rough,<br />
      the not so tiny ship was tossed<br />
      if not for the courage of the fearless crew,<br />
      the What If would be lost<br />
      the What If would be lost<br />
      <br />
      The ship set dock on that day<br />
      to replenish the supplies....<br />
      With Dean the man<br />
      the skipper too<br />
      Who is also the wife.<br />
      Derek the son<br />
      with Oso, and Sam<br />
      <br />
      So this is the tale of our runaways,<br />
      they&#39;re gone for a long, long time.<br />
      They&#39;ll have to make the best of things,<br />
      and manage every dime<br />
      and manage every dime<br />
      <br />
      The first mate and his skipper too <br />
      will do their very best<br />
      to make the dogs comfortable<br />
      in their tiny nest<br />
      in their tiny nest<br />
      <br />
      No phone, no TV, no microwave<br />
      not a single luxury<br />
      like Robinson Crusoe<br />
      it&#39;s a long way from Boise<br />
      it&#39;s a long way from Boise<br />
      <br />
      So join us here right now my friends, <br />
      to give Dean a smile<br />
      from all us stranded land lovers<br />
      it&#39;s sure to be awhile<br />
      it&#39;s sure to be awhile<br />

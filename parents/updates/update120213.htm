				The last time we visited St. Lucia, Rodney Bay, we climbed to 
				the top of Pigeon Island, which is a state park, and viewed the 
				fort that was on both peaks.&nbsp; The lower peak has a bit more 
				of the fort remaining but the view from both peaks was worth the 
				walk.&nbsp; This time when we at the anchorage two other boats 
				and several kids joined in the hike.&nbsp; Derek found a flag 
				pole to climb, the peaks were not tall enough I guess.&nbsp; One 
				of the parents also gave lemon grass blowing lessons, the kids 
				became very proficient at it.<br />
				<br />
				We had not yet enjoyed the adventure of zip lining, but agreed to 
				go with &quot;Pollux&quot;,; the boat we are traveling with.&nbsp; &quot;Pollux&quot; has 3 boys 
				all around Derek&#39;s age.&nbsp; So off we go up into the Rain 
				Forest of St. Lucia to try out 9 different zip lines and mingle 
				with the tops of the trees.&nbsp; After getting outfitted with 
				hair nets, helmets, and harnesses we were set.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				There was a tram ride we took to the top of the mountain and 
				from there a short walk to our first platform.&nbsp; We had 
				eight in our party and two guides who hooked us up at each 
				platform and then unhooked us after our zipping.&nbsp; Each 
				platform was in a tree top and you kind of forgot how high up 
				you were.&nbsp; We did not have any rain to deal with, lucky 
				timing, and the weather was warm but not too hot, over all very 
				enjoyable.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Thanksgiving also came while we were anchored at St. Lucia.&nbsp; 
				Not much of a celebration when we were the only USA boat around.&nbsp; 
				Kris did make an apple pie, Dean made a pumpkin pie and we had 
				ham and mashed potatoes for dinner.&nbsp; Derek did not seem to 
				mind that no other boats were celebrating, more pie for him.&nbsp; 
				We are planning on meeting up with several other boats to 
				celebrate Christmas.<br />
				<br />
				On Sunday 12/1 we headed north to Martinique, Le Marin.&nbsp; 
				That was after filling up with diesel and having Kris work on 
				the starboard engine, unexpectedly it would not start and so she 
				had to trouble shoot it and fix it.&nbsp; As you can see in the 
				picture both Derek and Sam had a restful trip even though the 
				seas were a bit rough in the beginning of the trip.</div>

            ask John - something about failing a test).&nbsp; The day would not

        Sunday we left Block Island under cloudy skies and a forecast of winds
        out of the south 10-15 knots with gusts to 20 knots.&nbsp; What we got
        was winds 20-30 knots with gusts to 40 knots and up to 5 foot
        seas.&nbsp; Oh - did I mention the driving rain?&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all
        a good sail, and the boat preformed really well.&nbsp; In fact we could
        not believe the wind was that strong because we were pretty comfortable
        although wet.&nbsp; We got close to Old Saybrook and the sun came out
        and the wind lessoned and everything went up on the lines to
        dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        We really enjoyed Johns stay with us, and look forward to having him
        stay with us again.

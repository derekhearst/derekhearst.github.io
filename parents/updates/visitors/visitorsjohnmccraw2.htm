				Their story: <span class="style15">Parking the boat </span> </span>
				</p>
				<p class="style17">
				This was John&#39;s second time on the boat and and we really let 
				him have it this time.&nbsp; The night John showed up there was 
				a lightning and rain storm that he was able to watch from the 
				boat, just got to the boat in time to stay dry.&nbsp; We have 
				been using John&#39;s address to mail supplies and goodies to so he 
				had quite the bag of goodies to bring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p class="style17">
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="style17">
				The trip to Newport was more motoring than sailing but it was 
				not raining so it was a good day on the boat, better than at 
				work.&nbsp; We anchored between the New York Yacht Club and Ida 
				Lewis, in the special anchorage area.&nbsp; There were a lot of 
				boats here and other than re-anchoring a few times and then 
				watching another boat all night it wasn&#39;t too bad.&nbsp; We were 
				able to walk the town and see many of the old mansions that are 
				around town.
				</p>
				<p class="style17">
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="style17">
				We did get a decent sail with the spinnaker from Newport over to 
				Block Island.&nbsp; The anchorage at Block was very vacant so we 
				had a great spot to anchor and watch the boats in the harbor.&nbsp; 
				Last year we bicycled the east end of the island so this year it 
				was the west end.&nbsp; We rode out to the light house, not a 
				bad ride other than the hill just before you get there.&nbsp; 
				Since it was early in the day and Derek was wanting to play in 
				the surf we decided to ride to the east end as well.&nbsp; Made 
				it with a few aching muscles but Derek had a great time playing 
				in the surf.</p>
				<p class="style17">
				&nbsp;</p>
				<p class="style17">
				The trip back to Stonington was a great sail, 10-15 knots of 
				wind and the boat moved along at 5-6 knots.&nbsp; The weather 
				was cloudy and drizzly but it was an enjoyable trip back.</p>

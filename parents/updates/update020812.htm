				On the first Friday in February Farmers Cay in the Bahamas 
				host the 5F festival (First, Friday, February, Festival, Farmers)&nbsp; 
				It consists of local activities and get together centered around 
				sailboat races, specifically the class C Bahamian sloop boat.&nbsp; 
				This year there were 14 boats racing, one of the largest fleets.<br />
				<br />
				We were extremely fortunate to have an anchoring spot that ended 
				up with one of the turning marks of the race no more than 200 
				feet from out boat.&nbsp;
				They start the race from anchor, hoist the anchor, hoist the sail and 
				then round 
				the marks.&nbsp; The boats use boards called &quot;prides&quot; for the 
				fellows to sit on to counteract the force of the wind on the 
				sails, and keep the boats upright.&nbsp; The more the wind the 
				further out on the prides the people sit.&nbsp; You can tell in 
				a few pictures even with everyone out on the prides the boat is 
				still leaning a bit, it doesn&#39;t always work.<br />
				<br />
				We saw two of the sloops &quot;sink&quot; with only the masts sticking 
				up.&nbsp; Luckily, all the weight in the boats is in loose lead 
				weights, so when a boat sinks, they dive down, bring up all the 
				lead, and then the boat will float&nbsp; right about deck level.&nbsp; They 
				will tow the barely visible boat back to a shallow spot, and 
				begin bailing out the water, then get ready for the next race.&nbsp; 
				It is quite a sight to see.&nbsp; When you see people sitting in 
				the sunken boat being pulled back to the shore it is quite the 
				site<br />
				<br />
				When the festival was over, we hoisted the anchor and motored out of the anchorage.&nbsp; 
				Since we had some good winds out of the south and we were headed 
				north we sailed with our nicely 
				colored spinnaker back to Black Point Settlement.&nbsp; There 
				were about 10 other boats all headed back to Black Point as well 
				and we were the best looking one, also the fastest since we were 
				the only ones with a spinnaker up.<br />
				<br />
				Had a great sail until we turned on our engines to anchor, and 
				found that one engine seemed to have no power.&nbsp; After we 
				anchored Derek dove down and came up with the sad news , one 
				engine was missing a prop.&nbsp; But that is another story.<br />

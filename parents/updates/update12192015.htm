				Well, it has been a long time since this was updated.&nbsp; 
				Sorry about that.<br />
				<br />
				Life on land is just so much more dull than our travelling life, 
				that we really have nothing to say.&nbsp; I mean, does anyone 
				find any interest in reading about our trip&nbsp; to the store 
				now?&nbsp; No beach parties, no anchoring issues, no plumbing 
				fixes - just work and the old grind for a while for us.<br />
				<br />
				We have kept up with those lucky ones that are still out 
				cruising and enjoy reading about their adventures, please keep 
				the updates coming.<br />
				<br />
				We all miss different aspects of boat life - and some aspects we 
				don&#39;t miss.&nbsp; Derek is definitely in love with internet, and 
				spends most his free time on his computer playing with friends 
				online gaming.&nbsp; He is a sophomore in High School now, and 
				doing well taking honors Math, Biology and Engineering.&nbsp; He 
				really would prefer to be doing school online, as the behavior 
				of other students, and the amount of time wasted is a daily 
				irritation to him.<br />
				<br />
				Kris is working full time at a company called Vanmark Equipment, 
				as has been since October of 2014.&nbsp; The company build 
				equipment for big companies that takes potatoes, and cuts them 
				into french fry shapes.&nbsp; The company sells worldwide, so 
				next time you eat a french fry, chances are it was cut on the 
				equipment manufactured by her company.&nbsp; They also sell to 
				companies who slice apples, carrots, and peppers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Kris likes her job for the most part, but it doesn&#39;t really use 
				all of her skills, and the pay could be better, but it pays the 
				bills, and that is what the goal was for now.<br />
				<br />
				Dean started working for an Organic Chocolate company last 
				November 2014 - YUM - but unfortunately, it was a start up 
				company, and although they were doing well, they lost out on a 
				contract to get the product into a major grocery store, and the 
				owners did not want to take a chance that they may not make it 
				into the stores within the next 6 months, so decided to shut 
				down.&nbsp; So Dean was a expert chocolate guy for 3 months, we 
				all gained 10 pounds, and then he was out of work.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				He is still looking for a job, what since our bills our paid 
				from Kris&#39;s job, he is taking the time to find a company that 
				would be a good fit, and he would enjoy.<br />
				<br />
				We are still at the same apartment we first moved to.&nbsp; Dean 
				takes Sam for daily walks, but Sam is getting old, and slowing 
				down.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have our cat Sackett, which was at Kris&#39;s 
				folks while we were on the boat, and a new addition to the 
				family, a new kitten &quot;Smokey&quot; which we found while out for a 
				daily walk with Sam one night.&nbsp; We actually found 4 
				kittens, and we found homes for the other three, but this one 
				captured our hearts, so we decided to keep.<br />
				<br />
				We wish everyone a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, and 
				remind you all to follow your dreams sooner than later.<br />

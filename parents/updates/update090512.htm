				It doesn&#39;t seem like the summer is over but it is already 
				September and starting to cool off in the evenings.&nbsp; Last 
				year we were in the Chesapeake Bay area and this year we are 
				still in Connecticut.&nbsp; We thought the hurricane season was 
				going to be rough this year but so far it has been very mild, in 
				fact our summer has been extremely mild as well.<br />
				<br />
				We have worked on the boat some this summer, some work due to 
				the lightning storm but other maintenance work 
				and improvements as well.&nbsp; In the end about 150 
				projects completed.&nbsp; House/Boat cleaning was also active 
				and we did get some things off the boat via eBay so made money 
				in the activity.&nbsp; Spent time with friends, had some good 
				dinners, and overall have had a lazy relaxing summer :).<br />
				<br />
				Last week we started 7th grade school with Derek, not his most 
				favorite activity.&nbsp; We have gotten all our electronics back 
				and working and are planning our travels through New York&#39;s East 
				River and beyond.<br />
				<br />
				Some interesting facts:<br />
				Derek is close but not taller than his mother<br />
				Both dogs are still on the boat, but only one will make it out 
				of the U.S.<br />
				Have about 500 movies on board<br />
				The diesel engines are not leaking any oil or salt water<br />
				The water is much bluer in the Bahamas<br />
				Derek wants a new faster computer<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				Our plan today is to head to Virginia, where we will haul the 
				boat and work on the bottom, then keep heading south until we 
				stop and head west or back north.<br />
				Don&#39;t know which option yet - but we definitely plan on going 
				through the eastern Caribbean this season, just don&#39;t know where 
				we are going after that.&nbsp; We might summer in Trinidad, or 
				in Panama, or head north to the states again.</div>

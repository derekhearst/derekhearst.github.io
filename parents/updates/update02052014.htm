      We have enjoyed our time in the BVI&#39;s.&nbsp; We did not spend a lot of
      time here last year, so it was nice to hit some spots we hadn&#39;t
      been.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      Derek did more knee boarding, and is getting better and better.<br />
      <br />
      One of our favorite spots here in the BVI&#39;s is &quot;The
      Baths&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of rocks with caves and trails.&nbsp; We
      spent two days their with our friends on Pollux and had a good time.<br />
      <br />
      We also did some more mangrove scrounging.&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Dean and Derek
      were covered up to the thighs in dark sticky mangrove mud, but we did get
      some more stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings our total to 5 folding seats, 12
      fenders of various sizes, and one horseshoe buoy.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We took the fenders&nbsp; over to a charter company today, and they bought
      two of the best small ones for $20 each, so Derek was happy.&nbsp; We will
      try to sell the rest as we head north.<br />
      <br />
      We spent a few days in Road Town Tortola at anchor, and loaded up on
      groceries.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent some time trying to track down some new
      brushes for the electric motor on the watermaker, but no luck, so
      hopefully St. Thomas will have some.<br />
      <br />
      We also did some boat projects and found an old leak had rotted some
      non-structural wood pieces that hold the ceiling panel up in the master
      stateroom, so we replaced those, and verified that there were no more
      leaks.<br />
      <br />
      We will spend a couple more days here in the BVI&#39;s and then say
      goodbye to our friends on &quot;Pollux&quot; and head onto the U.S. Virgin
      Islands for a while.

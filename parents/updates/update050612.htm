				It is election day, May 7th 2012 for the Bahamas.&nbsp; While we 
				have been here we have seen many posters for the candidates and 
				several parades/rallies as well.&nbsp; The two political parties 
				are the FNM, Free National Movement , and the PLP, Progressive 
				Liberal Party.&nbsp; The FNM is very identifiable with red on 
				all their posters and the PLP goes with the yellow.&nbsp; There 
				are several other smaller groups but these two are the primary 
				political powers.<br />
				<br />
				As we have through the different islands it is easy to spot 
				which party is the island&#39;s choice by the number of posters.&nbsp; 
				We have talked to a few people and they are very committed to 
				their party and the election turn outs are usually over 85%.&nbsp; 
				Their elections are held every 5 years and if a new party gets 
				into office there is usually major change.&nbsp; Some of the 
				businesses really worry about what the changes will be.<br />
				<br />
				5/9/12 The votes have been counted and PLP has won.<br />

        >We had scheduled the open boat for a nice sunny day in June.&nbsp; We
        moved the boat to the transient dock, and got it all prettied up for our
        guests.&nbsp; The marina was having a &quot;parrot head&quot; event
        going on, so we anticipated live music and fun.<br />
        <br />
        What we got, was cold cold cold weather, with rain and wind.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Oh well, can&#39;t win them all.<br />
        <br />
        We ended up having a great time, with 43 people stopping by to say hi
        and see &quot;What If&quot;.&nbsp; The boat made a good showing of
        itself, by staying nice and dry and warm below, and seemed quite cozy -
        especially when we had 13 people at one time all inside.<br />
        <br />
        We would like to thank everyone who braved the weather and made it down
        to the boat, we really enjoyed visiting with you all.</span

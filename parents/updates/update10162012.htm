				We left Deltaville, and have been mostly motoring ever since.&nbsp; 
				Kris is complaining about being cold, so we are heading south.&nbsp;
				From Deltaville, we went to Portsmouth, VA, and anchored at a 
				place called Hospital Point.&nbsp; It is probably called that 
				because of the large hospital on the point - but we are just 
				guessing.&nbsp;
				We walked into town and got our McDonalds fix for dinner, and 
				had a peaceful night on the boat.<br />
				<br />
				The next morning we upped anchor at 6:30 to make it to the first 
				bridge opening in daylight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Us and 12 other boats 
				that is.&nbsp; It is definitely the time for the migration of 
				boats to the south.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most the boats are very polite 
				and the boats pass us courteously, but there is always one who 
				thinks different from the rest.&nbsp; We just laugh at those 
				folks, but other boaters feel the need to express their 
				displeasure vocally on the VHF radio, so it is always 
				interesting to sit back and listen.<br />
				<br />
				We motored down the ICW through the locks, and under the bridge 
				and than had to pull off and tie up to a free dock for about an 
				hour, as Kris remembered some good thrift stores in the town 
				right there, and sure enough, found some clothes at good prices.<br />
				<br />
				After the short delay, we were on the move again, motoring, but 
				at least were were fairly alone, as the mad rush of boats was 
				either in front of us by 30 minutes, or behind us by 30 minutes, 
				due to bridge opening schedules.&nbsp; We anchored that night at 
				a place called Blackwater Creek.&nbsp;&nbsp; They should have 
				named it &quot;creek full of bugs that die and stain the boat green&quot;, 
				for that is what happened.&nbsp; As the sun hit the green 
				stains, they turned black. We were trying to get the bugs off 
				the boat all day.&nbsp; We hosed off the dead ones, but the 
				lives ones just kept flying around.<br />
				<br />
				We motored on to Alligator River Marina.&nbsp; This is a 
				traditional stop for us, and as usual, we had nice long showers, 
				and ate at the restaurant for dinner.&nbsp; Before dinner and 
				showers though, we gave the boat a through scrubbing getting off 
				all the bug debris and stain.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also for the first 
				time, hooked up to power and ran our air conditioning and heater 
				to make sure they worked - which they did.<br />
				<br />
				After a nice night at Alligator River Marina, it was an early 
				morning and a 62 mile run to another peaceful anchorage, where 
				we had a short thunderstorm and rain - but no bugs thank 
				goodness.&nbsp; Now we are here in Beaufort, NC.&nbsp; We will 
				head to town, get groceries and work on an engine oil leak 
				before we leave.</div>

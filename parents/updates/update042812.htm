        After our visit on Long Island, we headed out to Conception Island for a
        couple of days.&nbsp; Conception Island is a Bahamas National Trust
        Island, and is uninhabited.&nbsp; You are not allowed to remove anything
        from the island or beaches, and one mile radius from the island.&nbsp;
        Once anchored, Kris got out the binoculars to investigate something
        white she saw She could not quite determine what she saw, but remained
        curious.
      </p>
      <p class="style1">
        <br />
        We took the dinghy up into the mangrove river, and saw many
        turtles.&nbsp; We saw about 30 or so, and once they saw us they zoomed
        away rather quickly.&nbsp; The next day, Kris&#39;s curiosity could not
        be sated, so Derek and Kris headed inland to find the mysterious white
        item.&nbsp; About 1/2 hour of looking, trekking through heavy scrub,
        they found it.&nbsp; It was a 12&#39; x 12&#39; collapsible awning with
        frame.&nbsp; It was in good shape, with only a small rip in the awning
        from where a topped palm tree must have stopped its inland tumble in the
        wind.&nbsp; Since the island is uninhabited, and the awning was a good
        1000 feet into the scrub and brush Kris decided to &quot;rescue&quot;
        it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took about 2 hours for Derek and Kris to
        extract the awning and get it collapsed due to the heavy brush and
        scrub, but eventually it made it back to the boat.&nbsp; Dean just shook
        his head.
      </p>
      <p class="style1">
        <br />
        The next day we snorkeled on the reefs around the island, and saw lots
        of coral and fishes.&nbsp; There was one small fish about 2&quot; long
        that hung out right at the stern of the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Derek enjoyed
        playing with him, as the fish did not move away at all, and you could
        put your face or hand right up to him.&nbsp; Due to a bad storm coming,
        we decided to head back to George Town for the best protection, because
        heading north to Cat Island did not have protection from the strong west
        winds forecasted.

        One of the stories we did not hear much about until we arrived in the
        Bahamas is about the &quot;Lion Fish&quot;.&nbsp; In 1992, Hurricane
        Andrew smashed an aquarium tank in Florida. About a half-dozen spiny,
        venomous lionfish washed into the Atlantic Ocean, spawning an invasion
        that could kill off local industry along with the native fish.&nbsp; Not
        sure if that is the only introduction of the fish but along the Eastern
        Coast the population of the Lion fish has multiplied faster than other
        fish they feed on, like grouper, snapper, and other game fish.&nbsp; The
        Lion fish&#39;s spines are poisonous so they do not have a natural
        predator.&nbsp; People are trying different approaches and&nbsp; one
        event was the &quot;First Bahamas Lionfish Derby&quot; which was a huge
        success: 1,408 lionfish taken in 1 day!&nbsp; We went after some with
        Bob and Anne and came back with 5 fish.&nbsp; Once you cut off the
        spines you can filet the fish and get some nice white meat.&nbsp; The
        fish are not that big so it does take a few to make a meal.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="style1">
        After the bad weather passed we planned on heading to Cat
        Island.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have enjoyed George Town but really wanted to
        head north and see other places.&nbsp; Well on Thursday the winds looked
        like they were favorable and off we went, again trying to make it to Cat
        Island.&nbsp; So maybe this year we are not suppose to go to Cat Island
        because based upon the winds and waves we choose&nbsp; a better option
        and that was to head back up the Exuma chain to Black Point.&nbsp; So
        sailing along with 25 knots of wind, seas were 4 to 8 foot and we needed
        to make a short passage through a narrow opening, no issues right?&nbsp;
        Something happened with our steering cable and other than giving us a
        <span class="style2">high</span> amount of stress as we neared the rocks
        with little to no steerage we did ok. :)
      </p>
      <p class="style1">
        So now we are in Black Point and have worked on our steering system, a
        couple of cable clamps decided to come undone.&nbsp; We fixed that
        problem and made sure the rest of the system was ok.&nbsp; It also
        allowed us to fix a small leak on our outside shower, repack the
        steering grease, grease the rudder post, and change the filters in the
        raw water intake.&nbsp; See everything worked out for the best :).
      </p>
      <p class="style1">
        The weather has been very unpredictable and not enjoyable lately.&nbsp;
        When we got to George Town the winds blew out of the south and west,
        normal is north and east, and were 25 to 35 knots.&nbsp; Most anchorages
        favor the &quot;normal&quot; winds so everyone sought the few that were
        not normal.&nbsp; For most of our time in the Bahamas we have not had
        rain but in the last week we have had squalls and rain storms almost
        everyday.&nbsp; It is becoming their rainy season so I guess it is
        normal but for us it is not as enjoyable.&nbsp; Again it is time to head
        north.

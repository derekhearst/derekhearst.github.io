      Well we made it to Georgetown Bahamas a month earlier than last
      year.&nbsp; We thought last year we would continue on to the Caribbean but
      did not, so this year we left the U.S. earlier and planned on getting to
      Puerto Rico by mid Jan.&nbsp; So far we have not made it past the Bahamas
      but it really isn&#39;t our fault - blame the weather.<br />
      <br />
      When we left the US we waited 3 weeks in Miami Beach Florida waiting for
      the winds to die down and let us head east.&nbsp; Since arriving in
      Georgetown we have been waiting for the winds to allow us to head
      east.&nbsp; I suppose we could be the tough sailors&#39; and brave the 10
      foot seas and 20/30 knots of winds out of the east and just &quot;Do
      It&quot; but I guess we are a bit more of wimps or prudent sailors.<br />
      <br />
      The time here we have used to: play volleyball, Derek play with his
      friends, walks on the beach, potlucks with other boats, project
      completions, Kris helping other boaters with projects.&nbsp; So you see
      the time has not been wasted.&nbsp; And with the cabin temperature staying
      around 75 to 80 Kris has stayed warm during the days and nights :).&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      There are now 100 + boats here at the anchorage and probably 20% are
      waiting for a weather window to head east.&nbsp; Some will continue on to
      the Caribbean Islands while others will head east then south onto
      Panama.&nbsp; Over the next month to the number of boats will increase to
      over 300, most coming for the winter and the cruiser regatta/party.&nbsp;
      There are several folks that we had met last year that are arriving here
      now so it has been fun catching up on their past years travel and
      activities.<br />
      <br />
      On Jan 15th we left Georgetown and made it to Long Island Bahamas, not a
      long trip but it is 35 miles further east.&nbsp; As the weather looks now
      we should be able to leave the northern end of Long Island on Sunday and
      head east.&nbsp; Over the next 4 to 5 days we will go south and&nbsp; east
      as long as the weather allows&nbsp; with the hope of arriving in the
      western end of Puerto Rico.&nbsp; But as you have seen our plans are
      always flexible depending upon weather and conditions.<br />
      <br />
      We will be travelling in the company of our friends on &quot;Good
      Trade&quot;, so at least if the trip is miserable we will have company.<br />

      We spent only about 4 days in St. Lucia.&nbsp; The main reason to stop,
      well, was to stop, and also for provisioning.&nbsp; St. Lucia probably had
      the best grocery stores since Puerto Rico.&nbsp; We went to the Mega J
      store, which is like a mini Costco and loaded up on some bulk items.&nbsp;
      We also hit the Super J, which is an IGA food store for all the rest of
      the stuff we wanted.&nbsp; We filled up in fuel in St. Lucia as well, so
      we dropped plenty of cash for that country.&nbsp; St. Lucia <br />
      <br />
      We left St. Lucia in the afternoon and headed south to Grenada.&nbsp; We
      had heard good/bad info about stopping at St. Vincent and decided to go
      ahead and miss it on the way south.&nbsp; It would have been expensive to
      check into and out of St. Vincent, and due to restrictions, and Sam would
      not be allowed ashore.&nbsp; The sail south was very enjoyable, had winds
      of 15 to 20 knots and the seas were only 4 to 6.&nbsp; As you can see in
      the picture of the boat there are some good waves.&nbsp; We had a great
      view of the rest of St. Lucia and then had the company of several dolphins
      for awhile.&nbsp; We passed the island of St. Vincent in the dark but we
      had a full bright moon to help illuminate the way, it was a very nice
      sail.&nbsp; Along the way we had a flying fish land on the deck and not
      get back into the sea, as you can see it was not much of a meal.<br />
      <br />
      On the trip down the coast,&nbsp; Kris heard a noise and investigated it
      and found that our autopilot bracket was broken.&nbsp; The aluminum
      bracket had just fatigued&nbsp; over the last 20 years and finally had
      enough and broke.&nbsp; In Grenada where we are anchored there happened to
      be an Aluminum boat builder/repairer and he was able to fix the bracket
      and we were able to reinstall it already.&nbsp; Hopefully it will last
      another 20 years.<br />
      <br />
      Grenada does have a few islands that make up the country and we are in the
      northern island, Carriacou, which is 20 miles north of the main island of
      Grenada.&nbsp; We are playing here in the water and taking a few hikes in
      the hills near by and will travel down to the main island with in the next
      week.&nbsp; In the anchorage there are four boats that have kids to they
      are having a great time playing in the water and enjoying the
      weather.&nbsp; Two of the boats are from Italy and the spoken English is
      very limited but that does not seem to impact the play at all.<br />
      <br />
      The other day we took a hike with the folks off of Day Dreamer.&nbsp; They
      had taken the hike last year so they knew the road and trail we needed to
      take.&nbsp; We were glad they lead the way because we would not have found
      it to the top of the hill without them.&nbsp; We did see some wild life on
      the trip; goats, sheep, donkey, and a couple of turtles.&nbsp; One turtle
      was almost at the top of the hill and was rather large while the smaller
      one was at the bottom of the hill.&nbsp; We did have one casualty, Lisa
      off of Day Dreamer lost her hat, the winds were blowing briskly and one
      minute her hat was on her head and the next it was traveling over the
      cliff down the hill.&nbsp; We looked for it but the trees/bush/steep hill
      did not allow much of a hunt for it.<br />

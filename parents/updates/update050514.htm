      We had a couple of great days sailing north from Georgetown.&nbsp; In fact
      the sailing has been so good, we only made on stop for longer than the
      night.&nbsp; We did some snorkeling and saw some nice fish, some great
      coral and and one large barracuda.&nbsp; Derek took some frozen broccoli
      out, and was mobbed by fish trying to get some.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goal of
      moving north was primarily to get up to Nassau, Bahamas to visit the
      Atlantis Resort.<br />
      <br />
      We have passed by the Atlantis Resort and water park in Nassau 3 times
      now, and never have stopped, but since we did not think we would be back
      for awhile we thought this was the time to stop.&nbsp; The cost per day is
      $125 per person but if you use the marina for your boat then the cost to
      the water park is included in the marina fee.&nbsp; Of course the marina
      fee is rather high, $4.00 per foot where normally you see if for $1.00 to
      $2.00 per foot.&nbsp; If you do the math it still is cheaper to pay to
      park the boat vs. the entrance fees.<br />
      <br />
      The water park has several rides, pools, and a pretty good aquarium as
      well.&nbsp; It also has a casino, theatre, and lots of
      restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our friends on Good Trade stopped here with us,
      so Derek has had a lot of fun with his friend Kyler doing all the water
      rides.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have done the more adventures rides, but Kris
      refuses any ride that doesn&#39;t involve a tube to float on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Even the tube rides here don&#39;t mean you don&#39;t get completely
      submerged at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      We have had a lot of fun, and spent too much money on eating out, but now
      it is time to get going again.&nbsp; We plan on being back in Florida by
      this weekend, and hopefully the weather will cooperate.<br />
      <br />
      We did get some bad news, our friends Jack and Marce on &quot;Escape
      Velocity&quot; were just dismasted in the Pacific.&nbsp; To read more see
      their blog at&nbsp;
      <a href="http://escapevelocity.mobi/"> http://escapevelocity.mobi/</a
      >&nbsp;&nbsp; We feel horrible for them, but glad no one was
      hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just makes you remember that it is not all fun and games
      - this cruising.&nbsp; And when something breaks, it is much more
      significant when out at sea on a boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

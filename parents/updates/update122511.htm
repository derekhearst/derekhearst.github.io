      Southern Florida along the ICW shows a lot of wealthy people, their homes
      and boats.&nbsp; The homes seem to be in the 5 to 10 millions and then the
      boats in front of the house is another 2 to 4 million.&nbsp; There are a
      few that are well over that but it is not an area for the poor.&nbsp;
      Currently we are anchored in Northern Palm Beach and in the next couple of
      days we will head to Miami.&nbsp; We have heard that you have to go to
      South Beach and see the sites as well.&nbsp; From Miami it is an easier
      crossing to Bahamas and you do not have to fight the Gulf Stream, the 2 to
      4 knot current that runs north along the Florida coast.<br />
      <br />
      The boat is about ready, we did have to replace the depth instrument, it
      was original so it is not too surprising.&nbsp; The sails, motor, and now
      the water maker are all running smoothly and ready to go.&nbsp; We have
      been provisioning and with the water line running a bit lower we are
      stocked up with food for the next 3 to 5 months.&nbsp; Well at least the
      stables are on board and we will add fresh fruits and such as we pull into
      different stops.&nbsp; We have also heard that paper products are
      expensive in the islands as well so there is a large supply in the forward
      berth.<br />
      <br />
      At the last anchorage Derek caught the mighty cat fish what had been
      bothering the dogs.&nbsp; Ok so the fish did not bother the dogs but Derek
      did catch a nice 14 inch cat fish that we returned to the wild.&nbsp;

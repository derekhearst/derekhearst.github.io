      So the boat goes in the water on June 2nd, 1 1/2 weeks away.&nbsp; Our
      list of projects is now detailed by who and what specific day it is due
      by.&nbsp; The book shelves were added on the port side look really good,
      Rob Dalton did a great job.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris is now sanding and applying
      many coats of polyurethane, they look like they were always there.&nbsp;
      Since they look so good Kris started to strip the floors and is half way
      done with them.&nbsp; The floors were aged or just yellowed and once the
      finish has been removed she will do a light sand and then apply floor
      polyurethane.<br />
      <br />
      We worked on the port sail drive, installing the rubber boat and then the
      fiberglass faring.&nbsp; The starboard sail drive has been sanded and now
      needs primed and painted, this week if the rain stops.&nbsp; We had a
      quart of bottom paint that Dean used on Sunday in some of the more
      critical areas.&nbsp; It was suppose to be green to match the current
      bottom paint but it does not match.&nbsp; That&#39;s ok since we were
      planning on painting the entire bottom with Pettit Ultima SR 60 that we
      purchased at the Defender spring sail.<br />
      <br />
      Kris and Derek worked on covering some of the old holes in the dodger,
      5200 and plastic screw covers are amazing.&nbsp; We also installed the
      official name on the bow and stern of the boat.&nbsp; Kris is working hard
      on the dingy chaps, her sewing projects seem to be big and complicated but
      they are looking good.&nbsp; Kris is also working on transferring our home
      files from the desk top computer to the new Dell laptop.&nbsp; That also
      means we need to do file clean up and sorting, just more time.

      It has only been a week or so that we have been in Samana Bay in the&nbsp;
      Dominican Republic but we have tried to see all sides of it.&nbsp; We
      started off at the town of Santa Barbara and then sailed to the west and
      ended at the end of the bay in Sanchez.&nbsp; From there we sailed to the
      southern side of the bay and spend time in the Los Haitises National
      Park.<br />
      <br />
      Most cruisers do not head west from here and when we asked for permission
      we were told yes but why would we want to go, there are no services for
      the boat.&nbsp; We said that was O.K. and headed west.&nbsp; When we
      stopped at Sanchez we were greeted by many folks, mostly young and all
      wanted to help, for a slight tip.&nbsp; An older gentleman walked around
      the village and show us the town and sites, the church has just been
      restored.<br />
      <br />
      On the way to the next anchorage we sucked salt water into our engine
      again - So Kris had a &quot;pleasant&quot; three hour trip into the engine
      again to fix that.&nbsp; At least we figured out how it was happening, so
      won&#39;t have to deal with that again.<br />
      <br />
      The islands over by the park are rugged and lush with plants and
      birds.&nbsp; In the park we took a trip up a mango swamp and then into a
      cave.&nbsp; The cave had been used along time ago and the drawings on the
      walls showed several symbols of fish/birds/people.&nbsp; Continuing around
      the island we met up with two park employees who after showing us another
      cave sat down and allowed us to practice our Spanish.&nbsp; Ross off
      &quot;Good Trade&quot; and Kris are the best speakers and it is amazing
      where the conversations go, politics, business, food, you name the subject
      it can be discussed.&nbsp; Of course Derek and Kyler were doing some
      studying of their own.<br />
      <br />
      From the brief amount of the DR we have seen it is a diverse area and has
      a lot to offer.&nbsp; Another cruiser we talked to had rented a car and
      was able to tour more of the area and they would like to find a job and
      settle down here.&nbsp; The weather has been in the mid 80s in the day
      time and a few brief rain storms come through every other day or so.&nbsp;
      The area we have been in is very steep and hilly so the rain run off can
      be an issue.<br />
      <br />
      On Saturday 2/16 we are planning on going east, weather still looks good,
      and checking into Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and then down to Boqueron for a
      few days.&nbsp; We plan on cruising the south coast and eventually make it
      to Fajardo on the North East side.

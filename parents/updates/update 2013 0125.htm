      Well we are here in Provindenciales in the Turks and Caicos.&nbsp; We
      obviously did not make it to Puerto Rico as planned, as the weather had
      other ideas.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We left the north end of Long Island, Bahamas, and headed south and east
      with the best intentions.&nbsp; Along the way we caught a 2 1/2 foot
      Wahoo, which are supposed to be good eating, and a 2 foot Dorado.&nbsp; We
      got the Dorado - also known as a Mahi Mahi, on the boat, but he slipped
      out of Deans hands and made a break for it.&nbsp; Kris barely beat him to
      the cockpit door and got it shut before he hopped though into the
      cabin.&nbsp; We had blood spatters all over the cockpit to clean up from
      his or her little adventure.&nbsp; We put lines through the gills of both
      fish, and drug them a while, for this way they bleed out and die.&nbsp;
      After about 10 minutes we went to haul them in to filet them, and low and
      behold the Wahoo was gone.&nbsp; The Wahoo have such sharp teeth, that its
      teeth sawed through the rope holding him and the poor dead thing floated
      off - shark food for sure.&nbsp; We did get in Dorado in and cut up and
      will make a nice couple of meals.<br />
      <br />
      The seas were quite lumpy and the wind on the nose, and a 3 to 4 foot chop
      on the nose as well - not what the weatherman predicted.&nbsp; So plans
      changed and we tucked in after a long night out to a small anchorage
      called Attwood harbor on the northwest end of Acklins Island.<br />
      <br />
      A good rest, beach walk, the boys body surfing and a good nights sleep and
      we headed out again, with a new plan of just making it to the Turks and
      Caicos, as the weather was not allowing for Puerto Rico just yet.<br />
      <br />
      We did make it to the Turks and Caicos, and are here anchored with some
      other friends as well.&nbsp; We are the smallest catamaran here with
      &quot;No Rehearsal&quot; a 52&#39; Catana, &quot;Remi D&quot; a 50 foot
      Lagoon, &quot;Good Trade&quot; a 44&#39; PDQ and then us and our 38&#39;
      Manta.&nbsp; We all know each other and will be sitting here waiting on
      weather until we can all make the jump further east to Puerto Rico and
      beyond.

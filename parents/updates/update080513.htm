      On the cruisers net in the morning there are several taxi drivers that
      advertise different tours of the island.&nbsp; We got together with 3
      other boats who had kids and signed up with one of the taxis.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Joe George was our tour guide for the &quot;half day&quot;.&nbsp; We were
      picked up at 9 am and finally dropped off at 4:30 pm, a very nice/fun day
      and we saw a lot.<br />
      <br />
      The island of Grenada is only 133 sq. miles but the roads are narrow,
      twisty, and hilly.&nbsp; It took about an hour to drive from the south end
      of the island almost to the north end to the Chocolate Company, Belmont
      Estates.&nbsp; The cacao bean is grown on the estate, fermented, dried and
      then shipped to the chocolate making operation just up the road.&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      The estate has a tour that takes you through the entire process and talks
      about it&#39;s history since the 1600s and now is owned by a Grenada
      family.&nbsp; The estate produces all organic produce and supplies several
      of the local restaurants with fresh produce.&nbsp; We sampled the cacao
      beans fresh off the tree.&nbsp; Smelled the fermenting beans, it takes
      five days to ferment and they are turned into a new bin after two
      days.&nbsp; We even turned the cacao bean on the drying racks with our
      feet.&nbsp; The beans are to be turned every 2 hours for 4 days.&nbsp;
      Then the beans are ready to be bagged and shipped to the factory for
      grinding and molding into the chocolate bars.&nbsp; The best part was the
      sampling of the chocolate, 60%, 71%, 82%, and the ultimate 100%.&nbsp; We
      even tried chocolate tea.<br />
      <br />
      After getting our samples and then buying the bars to take home it was
      back into the bus and onto the water falls.&nbsp; Seven Sisters Waterfalls
      is very picturesque but we only saw two of the seven waterfalls.&nbsp;
      From the bus it is a good 1/2 hour hike into the falls along a narrow
      trail but when you see the falls the hike is forgotten.&nbsp; There are
      two pools and both are deep enough you can not touch bottom.&nbsp; The
      sign at the start says no jumping but there were several jumps from other
      people.<br />
      <br />
      Having our bus driver Joe telling us about the history and culture of
      Grenada was an added bonus.<br />

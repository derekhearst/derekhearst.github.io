				<span class="style1">There is a cruiser saying about Vero Beach 
				Florida, they call it&nbsp; Velcro Beach because it can hook you 
				and keep you longer than you planned.&nbsp; We planned on 5 days and 
				stayed 6 so it wasn&#39;t too bad but it could have been a lot 
				longer.&nbsp; The area is really set up to cater to the cruiser 
				and so people usually stay longer and spend more money than 
				planned.&nbsp; The marina is very friendly, has a good laundry 
				facility and nice hot showers.&nbsp; The local bus stops at the 
				marina, runs every hour, and is free (they do take donations).&nbsp; 
				The bus runs past the West Marine, Publixs, Wal-Mart, Home 
				Depot, and the mall (what more could you want).<br />
				<br />
				The 
				marina has mooring balls that people are tied up to and with it 
				being busy usually there are two or three boats tied together at 
				the mooring.&nbsp; For us it was nice because first we were tied 
				to a Manta 40, Salty Paws, then a couple days later to another 
				Manta 40, Faring, then to a Leopard 39, and then finally to 
				another Manta 40, Esmeralda.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the other Manta 
				owners we were able to share ideas and issues about the boat and 
				figure out ways to make ours even better.&nbsp; There were over 
				a hundred boats in the anchorage so talking to other cruisers 
				about getting to this spot and what plans they had for the 
				future helped us make our plans.&nbsp; Derek was also able to 
				meet some kids on other boats and play for several days with 
				them.&nbsp; Everyone has a different pace and direction so we 
				might meet up with them in the future but one never knows.<br />
				<br />
				We have been spotting more and more Manatees and in fact tonight 
				we are anchored in Manatee Pocket.&nbsp; So a few facts about 
				the Manatees;
				<br />
				</span><font size="2" class="style1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				manatee&#39;s closest relatives are the elephant.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They consume 10-15% of their body weight in vegetation daily.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manatees have been known to stay submerged for up to 20 
				minutes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Length: 10-12 feet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weight: 1,500-1,800 lbs.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifespan: 50-60 years in the wild.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rarely do individuals venture into waters that are below 68 
				degrees F<br />
				Usually you will see a circle of water with some bubbles and 
				then their nose will appear and in the next 5 to 10 seconds you 
				will see they back followed by their big flipper.&nbsp; It is 
				rather exciting to see them and our friend &quot;Eagle Eye Bob&quot; can 
				spot them faster than anyone else.<br />
				<br />
				So now we are waiting for a couple of packages to catch up with 
				us, we usually have them shipped general delivery to the post 
				office of a city we are going to spend some time at.&nbsp; Not 
				the most scientific way but it usually finds us with out much 
				trouble.&nbsp; After our goodies arrive we then get to sit with 
				everyone else and watch the weather.&nbsp; The Gulf Stream flows 
				between Florida and the Bahamas and creates a current of 2 to 4 
				knots flowing to the north.&nbsp; If the winds are out of the 
				north the opposing wind/current creates waves of 5 to 10 feet 
				and usually it is recommended that you do not try and cross with 
				that kind of weather.&nbsp; As the fronts move through the area 
				the winds will clock from the north to the east then south and 
				finally west.&nbsp; With that in mind everyone is watching the 
				weather to find when will the winds move to the south which will 
				allow the seas to be 0 to 4 feet.&nbsp; There are not that many 
				spots where you make the crossings so if the weather does not 
				give good southerly winds the&nbsp; anchorages will get fuller 
				and fuller of boats waiting to make the crossing.<br />
				<br />
				We will probably wait for some packages, do some more 
				provisioning, and then make the crossing with the weather.&nbsp; 
				We will probably continue to move south as we wait, as Miami is 
				the closest to the Bahamas we might as well head south to make 
				the crossing more comfortable and a shorter distance.<br />

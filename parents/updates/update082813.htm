      The time continues to fly by,&nbsp; but some how we have managed to
      squeeze in activities to see the island and have fun.&nbsp; One of the
      sites we wanted to see was the water slides, like a water fall but this
      one you can sit down on the rocks and slide down into the pool at the
      bottom.&nbsp; There are two sets of slides and the first one is the
      steepest but ends in a small pond, that is&nbsp; really more of a
      puddle.&nbsp; This sets you up for the last slide that drops you into the
      deep pool.<br />
      <br />
      We had taken a bus to the slides and there were two other boat families
      that wanted to go so we had 11 all out enjoying the water.&nbsp; One of
      the boats &quot;Moana Roa&quot; has two boys about Derek&#39;s age so he
      had some other dare devils to slide down the rocks with as well as taking
      the leap off the rocks into the pool.&nbsp; There is a second water falls
      that is further up the creek and it is a good picture taking one, too tall
      for any jumping.<br />
      <br />
      We all had a good time, and we were ready to head back home, because it
      was Cricket day.&nbsp; On Fridays, a group of cruisers get together and
      plays Cricket on a large lawn at one of the marinas.&nbsp; We are not
      familiar with Cricket, but it isn&#39;t terribly hard to pick up the
      basics, so Dean joined in with the game.&nbsp; He got up to bat once and
      had one good hit, where he scored six runs, and then the second hit was
      caught, so he was out.<br />
      <br />
      Kris and Derek were spectators for a while, but then they headed down to
      the marina bar to watch the Louis Vuitton cup races, which are
      preliminaries to the Americas Cup races.&nbsp; The new catamarans they use
      don&#39;t so much sit on the water,&nbsp; but almost fly though the air
      and are incredible to watch.&nbsp; If you get a chance, you really should
      watch a race.<br />
      <br />
      No hurricanes yet heading our way, so we will continue to wait here in
      Grenada before moving on.&nbsp;

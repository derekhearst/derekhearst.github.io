      Corn and more Corn<br />
      When we left Bridgeport CT I always thought the most common crop was
      wheat.&nbsp; After driving to Oregon and back we saw corn fields in just
      about every state.&nbsp; Looking at USA corn production web site it shows
      Ohio as the state producing the most corn in the US.&nbsp; There were some
      wheat fields as well but I think the hay/grass fields probably took second
      after the corn.<br />
      <br />
      The trip was over 6,500 miles and with the mighty 92 Jeep we had no
      problems.&nbsp; The last morning gave us a down pour as we were getting
      ready so while we feed the dogs and packed Dean and Kris were drenched and
      had to change clothes prior to driving.&nbsp; Each state had something
      unique about it like the state of Wyoming was loaded with trains and Iowa
      was heavy with wind mills.<br />
      <br />
      We took a few extra days on the trip so are getting back on Monday and now
      the real work begins.&nbsp; We need a trip to New England Electronics for
      our replacement autopilot controller.&nbsp; A trip to Defender to pick up
      a bilge alarm, CO2 alarm, smoke alarm, a new fan for Derek, and line for
      the head sail.&nbsp; We ordered the components for the Manta sling seat
      from JSI and that should be ready to install, at least attach it to the
      arch and then make the seat for it later.&nbsp; We are carrying some free
      <span class="style2"><span class="style3">vinyl mesh</span></span>
      material from Lee who had gotten it from us several years ago that will be
      used for the seat.&nbsp; Go to the grocery stores and buy enough stuff to
      last us awhile.&nbsp; Sell the mighty Jeep, Kris would love to keep it but
      has agreed selling it makes sense.&nbsp; In selling the jeep we also have
      to take the license plate to the DMV, take the DMV receipt to our
      insurance company and then take the DMV receipt to the town hall so we do
      not have to keep paying taxes on it.&nbsp; Of course do all that after the
      jeep is sold makes for long walks or having a friend drive you around all
      day.<br />
      <br />
      So after our 18 day &quot;vacation&quot;, 10 of which were driving, and
      after the last 6 days of final provisioning/projects the &quot;What
      If&quot; adventures can begin.&nbsp; I think we might just anchor close by
      and take two days to sleep and slow down :)<br />
      Our last day at the dock is July 31st so on to the seas.<br />

      Since the press is always right I want you to know that we now are the
      &quot;crew if a luxury yacht&quot;.&nbsp; It all started when Derek
      thought he heard people talking on another boat in the anchorage.&nbsp;
      After looking around in the dark we did not really identify anything but
      after Kris went up on deck and used the spot light she found a gentleman
      floating in the bay waving his arms.&nbsp; We put the dingy in the water
      and brought him back to the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp; The poor guy was dehydrated
      and exhausted.&nbsp; He told us his boat sank and he had been swimming for
      6 hours.&nbsp; He was wearing a shorty wetsuit, tank, snorkel, mask and
      flippers, so at least he had good gear and buoyancy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
      also said there was another guy who was diving with him that was also
      swimming in.&nbsp; We got his a towel and a shirt to put on to warm up,
      some water and some food and then called the Antigua Coast Guard.&nbsp;
      While we waited for the Coast Guard, which only took about 10 minutes to
      make it to the boat, the poor guy nearly passed out from exhaustion.&nbsp;
      The Coast Guard boat came alongside and 4 of the coasties came aboard and
      took the guys statement and took our name and information as well.&nbsp;
      They were all very polite and courteous.&nbsp; Then they all shook our
      hands and said thanks, and the fellow we rescued did as well.&nbsp; They
      took the guy to the medical center for a check up, and then went out to
      search for the second guy.&nbsp; We did not know if they found him or not,
      but then saw the article in the paper, and now know that they did. <br />
      <br />
      After our heroic efforts we continued on our journey/exploration of
      Antigua we headed south and pulled into Deep Harbor.&nbsp; There are many
      forts on the island used by the British and the one on top of the hill
      gave a great view of this harbor and of St John harbor, the major harbor
      for the island.&nbsp; We spent some time snorkeling the wreck of an 3
      master iron barque with a load of pitch that caught fire, burned and sank
      near the entrance to the bay.&nbsp; The wood burned, but the steel frames
      are mostly still there, and it was a nice snorkel trip.&nbsp; We would
      have like to spend more time in Deep Harbor, but the flies were so bad,
      they drove us out the same day - first time that has happened.<br />
      <br />
      Next on the port of call was English Harbor, the buildings/fort around the
      harbor was interesting to walk through and learn it&#39;s history.&nbsp;
      There is a 2 mile hike that takes you to the top of the hill outside the
      fort which was used as a lookout.&nbsp; The trail also winds down by the
      ocean and out to another point overlooking the entrance to the bay.&nbsp;
      The walks on the islands were fun and you always had the chance of seeing
      goats.&nbsp; Sam really thought he should do some herding but the goats
      had other ideas.<br />
      <br />
      We found Antigua to be a beautiful island, especially the western
      side.&nbsp; We have a few more places to see yet before hurricane season,
      so we set sail for Guadalupe on the 19 of May and had a beautiful sail
      into Guadeloupe.&nbsp; We are now anchored in Deshaies (pronounced
      Day-ay).&nbsp; We will check in tomorrow, and pick up some fresh baguettes
      and pastries, as we are back in the French islands.

      It was back in June when we arrived in Grenada to find a spot for the
      hurricane season.&nbsp; The forecast for hurricanes predicted a higher
      than normal season and if it looked like one was going to come by we
      thought we would head south to Trinidad if needed.&nbsp; It turned out to
      be a very mild hurricane season, so no bad weather for us.&nbsp; In the
      end we did go south to see Trinidad, but just for sight seeing vs. weather
      driven.<br />
      <br />
      Now that it is November; most of the cruising boats are starting to head
      north, and&nbsp; it is time for us to do the same.&nbsp; Looking back over
      the time spent here it was very enjoyable for all and we met many great
      people.&nbsp; Derek had more kids to play with than we imagined,&nbsp; and
      the kid&#39;s camp was a great way to start the summer.&nbsp; Sam had a
      great area for his morning walks and started to even enjoy swimming around
      the boat in the afternoon to cool down.&nbsp; The water was even warm
      enough that Kris could enjoy the morning noodleing, ie water aerobics.<br />
      <br />
      Cruisers pass around movies and books to one another frequently.&nbsp; One
      of the movies that had been passed around is Heartbreak Ridge which had
      some of the US invasion of Grenada on it.&nbsp; We have recently watched
      it and the movie is NOT on our recommended list to watch.&nbsp; If you are
      needing to waste two hours and do not want to sleep we still would
      <strong>not</strong> recommend watching this movie - it really is that
      bad.<br />
      <br />
      Our cruising plans now are to head north with several other boats, most of
      them with kids.&nbsp; We are looking to spend Thanksgiving at St. Lucia,
      not that there will be much of a celebration because the other boats are
      from Canada, Australia, and England.&nbsp; As you might guess our
      Thanksgiving is not much of a holiday for those folks.&nbsp; We do plan on
      spending Christmas around Antigua and should have a great time with the
      other folks for that holiday.<br />
      <br />
      After the holidays it will be continuing on to the BVIs, American VIs,
      Puerto Rico, Bahamas, and then onto the east coast of the US, where we
      will spend some time land travelling, and then unfortunately, start
      looking for work again :(&nbsp;&nbsp; ---- but who knows - what if our
      stocks do really well, or what if we think maybe we want to do the western
      Caribbean, or what if?????

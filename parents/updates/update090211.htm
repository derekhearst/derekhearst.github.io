      Kris asked the other morning so does it seem like we have been gone only a
      month?&nbsp; No, it seems a lot longer for some reason.&nbsp; 8/29 seemed
      to be the first day we were at anchor and we had a very relaxing
      day.&nbsp; We did go to shore and walked around the Mount Harmon
      Plantation.&nbsp; It is an old restored tobacco plantation that has public
      tours on the weekends.&nbsp; The rest of the time there is no one there,
      but we were fee to roam the grounds, and go on the trails around the place
      which was about 4 miles of trails which the dogs really enjoyed.&nbsp; We
      saw deer, turtles, lots of birds and even watched a raccoon wander in
      front of us.&nbsp; We did a couple of projects, tightening the steering
      cables, rigging the jib after the hurricane, attaching the sling seat, but
      overall nothing that took over an hour.<br />
      <br />
      Derek had been asking for his inflatable kayak to get brought out - so
      that is now on the deck and being used.&nbsp; We also brought out his tube
      that is pulled behind the dingy, seems like he could do that all
      day.&nbsp; The weather has been sunny and warm, in the mid 80s and the
      water is in the mid 70s but is not really salty so it is enjoyable to jump
      in and cool off.<br />
      <br />
      At times you have to select an anchorage that has groceries and laundry
      with in walking distance.&nbsp; Researching those sometimes becomes
      difficult but if you get internet you can usually use Google maps or
      MapQuest to find what is around those anchorages.&nbsp; Then the fun
      begins for instance here on Tar Cove we found two grocery stores with in a
      mile of the boat but trying to get the dingy onto shore is now the
      issue.&nbsp; There are houses along the shore line that prefer you not
      walk on their property, marinas want you to pay for a slip vs. just tying
      up your dingy.&nbsp; We did find one community boat ramp that we can use
      (as long as no one complains or catches us, as it is at a community park)
      for the groceries (green dot) but for laundry it is a bit further (orange
      diamond).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      We got groceries today, walked the .75 miles to the store, did our
      shopping, then carefully bagged our stuff and put it in our little pull
      cart and walked back with the groceries in the cart.&nbsp; It was a full
      cart as we spent over $200 this trip.&nbsp; We did a large shopping trip,
      as we never know when the next good grocery store will be, and this was a
      big nice store.&nbsp; We had lunch at the McDonalds next door.&nbsp;
      <br />
      We don&#39;t take the dogs on the grocery trips, and we put a harness on
      Sam and Oso and leave them on the boat, and usually give them a
      treat.&nbsp; Oso is fine, but Sam acts like he will die if he doesn&#39;t
      get to go, and barks until we are out of sight, but then calms down.<br />
      &nbsp;For the laundry, we will dinghy up the creek to a bridge and drop
      off Derek and Kris and they will walk 1/2 mile to the laundry and
      back.&nbsp; Dean had better be making dinner that night.<br />
      Dean dropped Kris and Derek off at a boatyard that doesn&#39;t really want
      us to tie up and they snuck through the yard and went up to a CVS with a
      redbox movie rental place.&nbsp; Tonight we will watch movies and have
      popcorn.<br />
      Tomorrow we will have to sneak them back.<br />
      This anchorage is nice and protected, a little boat rocking now and then
      from boat created swells, but the water isn&#39;t something you want to
      jump into, which is OK as it is cooler now, with rain in the forecast.<br />

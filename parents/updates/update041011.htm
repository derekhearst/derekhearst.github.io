        Old steering radial drive that needed to be cut out due to
        corrosion.&nbsp; Underneath this was&nbsp; a corroded rudder post
        bearing.

      That simple project of replacing the steering cable grease fitting is
      done.&nbsp; Replacing the grease fitting was easy, it was getting the old
      steering quadrant off, taking off the corroded rudder bearing, installing
      the new bearing, resetting the cables and then getting both rudders
      aligned that took the time.&nbsp; I think someone use to say &quot;if you
      are going to do a job well then do it 2 or 3, even 4 times&quot;.&nbsp; It
      seemed like we would get 90% of something done and then have to redo some
      of the work just to get back to the same completion level.&nbsp; Well
      after two new bearings, a new quadrant, several new drill bits and even a
      new drill the steering system looks to be 100% ready to go.&nbsp; Now it
      will be getting the auto pilot and other miscellaneous items reinstalled
      and this project might be &quot;done&quot;.

      Kris has also been working on the electrical system, our batteries were
      older than 5 years and had been dry when we purchased the boat.&nbsp; We
      replaced the Trojan 105s with new Trojan 105 plus and even went with 8
      batteries vs. the 6 that we had to begin with.&nbsp; New combiners for the
      engine and house batteries was also added.&nbsp; The wiring was not as
      straight forward as we wanted so now with a new electrical diagram the
      system is getting close to done.&nbsp; We have the two new Kyocera 135
      solar panels to add to our 4 Kyocera 80 panels with the Blue Sky
      controller to make sure everything works together and we should be set for
      awhile.

      One of our routines in the evenings is to watch a DVD on the TV.&nbsp; The
      TV is not that big but it does break up the evening and usually we eat
      dinner and have some popcorn during the show.&nbsp; We had a few movies
      and have added many on the way south with our biggest increase coming from
      Glenn and Linda McConnell when they sent us 55 movies they taped from TCM
      and AMC.&nbsp; You know all the classics that you always wanted to watch
      but never took the time.&nbsp; The other night we watched &quot;South
      Pacific&quot; and other than Derek being very bored of all the songs we
      enjoyed it.&nbsp; Prior to that we had gone through all the Harry Potter
      movies, that was Derek&#39;s selection.<br />
      <br />
      We have been anchored at Black Point for about a week now, the anchorage
      has been good for the winds, the village has good roads for walking the
      dogs, there is a great laundry facility, and we have snorkeled around the
      smaller islands.&nbsp; We are planning on going to the Little Farmer&#39;s
      Cay 5F Festival, the &quot;First Friday in February Farmers Cay
      Festival&quot;.&nbsp; It is only 15 miles away so we do not really have a
      push and since we have been enjoying the area why rush.&nbsp; After that
      we will eventually get to George Town, Exumas.&nbsp; There are reported
      150 or so other cruisers anchored there so should be able to find a few
      kids for Derek and other folks for us to hang out with.&nbsp; Dean&#39;s
      brother and wife will fly into George Town the 1st of March for a week on
      the boat.<br />
      <br />
      The weather forecast is not as easy to get when you leave the US where you
      can listen to the VHF and get the NOAA weather reports.&nbsp; There are
      several HAM radio operators who have scheduled broadcasts for boaters in
      different parts of the world.&nbsp; We have the option to listen to a
      6:30, 7:20 and 7:30 report, of course the 6:30 is the preferred one but
      when you do not have to get up early the 6:30 report does not always get
      listened to.&nbsp; The biggest concern is which direction is the wind
      blowing from and how strong.&nbsp; As a front passes through the area the
      winds will clock from the north to east, then south, and finally
      west.&nbsp; Depending upon how strong the front is the winds could make
      one anchorage good for a couple of nights but then you need to move to
      another one that is good for the other wind directions.<br />
      <br />
      Kris and Sam went for an exciting walk the other day, and were trying to
      find a trail to circle the north end of the island.&nbsp; They didn&#39;t
      find a trail, so they ended up making their own, which consisted of hiking
      over porous rock, through the wild brambles, threading though mangrove
      roots and even some wading for Kris and swimming for Sam.&nbsp; Sam was
      quite happy with the whole adventure, but they were both happy when they
      finally made it back to the road.&nbsp; Sam had to have a bath on the
      return.<br />
      <br />
      We took a trip to a neighbor island to look at some caves (depressions in
      the hill), watch some osprey and see the iguanas.&nbsp; We did some
      snorkeling as well, and saw some very large sea cucumber, as well as the
      normal assortment of coral, and fish.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We have been here long enough all the town folks are getting used to
      seeing the dogs, and just walk right up to pet them now.&nbsp; We get many
      comments about Oso being a &quot;wolf dog&quot;, and most people ask what
      kind he is.&nbsp; We tell them he is and Alaskan Malamute, and we get
      blank stares, then we say he is a sled dog, and everyone smiles and says
      &quot;Ahhh&quot;.&nbsp; All the little kids are afraid of the dogs, but
      after seeing them a couple of times, now they run up and pet them.&nbsp;
      Oso is doing OK in the heat as it helps his arthritis, but we have had to
      really cut down on the length of his walks.&nbsp; Sam seems to be
      thriving.&nbsp; We left the dogs on the boat the other day in their
      harnesses, and with bones, but when we came back Sam was out of his
      harness, but still on the boat waiting for us - we were quite relived to
      see.&nbsp; The dogs have taken to sleeping on deck all night which keeps
      Kris up with worry, so we have more homemade netting all around the boat
      now, and she only gets up two or three times a night to check on them.

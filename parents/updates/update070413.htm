      Some of you might think we just sit around all day/week/month and read
      books, listen to music, talk to other cruisers, do school, and generally
      relax.&nbsp; Well most of the time that is correct - but sometimes we
      actually do hard work.&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      Just the other day we had to clean the bottom of the boat.&nbsp; There are
      two ways to do this job, the first is have the boat hauled out of the
      water and clean it, usually with a high pressure hose.&nbsp; The second
      way is to clean it while it is in the water.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t ever
      clean your boat bottom, then the hull could start to look like the one in
      the picture with all the growth on it, not a very fast boat.<br />
      <br />
      When we have hauled our boat we clean it,&nbsp; and then apply new bottom
      paint to help keep things from growing on the hull. &nbsp; The top left
      picture is just after we had hauled the boat this last time and the top
      right picture is after we had applied new bottom paint.&nbsp;<br />
      <br />
      To clean the boat in the water you grab a hand brush, your snorkeling
      equipment and jump into the water.&nbsp; Your arm can reach about 2 to 3
      feet into the water and so you scrub the boat with you head at water
      line.&nbsp; After that you start to dive down, scrub for as long as you
      can hold your breath, come up for air and repeat.&nbsp; To do one side of
      the takes a good 30 minutes and since we have 2 hulls and 2 sides per hull
      it takes a good 2 hours to get the bottom all clean.&nbsp; Does not sound
      like much work but the diving and holding your breath while scrubbing
      takes a bit of practice, and gets quite tiring - not whining just
      informing.<br />
      <br />
      So you see we are not just sitting around doing nothing here.&nbsp; We
      will also have to clean and then wax the hull that is about the
      water.&nbsp; You might think going through the water would keep the hulls
      nice and clean but not the case.&nbsp; They also get dirty and more for
      looks than performance you need to at least clean the hull.&nbsp; With the
      amount of sun we are getting it is also useful to protect the fiberglass
      with wax -&nbsp; so you know the drill, wax on --- wax off, sore
      shoulders.<br />
      <br />
      If you want to practice what living on a boat could be like, then next
      time you clean your shower, clean the upper half, and then everything
      below waist level, hold your breath, clean, then stand up again before you
      breathe.&nbsp; While doing this, try to imagine fish swimming below and
      sometimes around you, and your shower walls moving back and forth with the
      wind.&nbsp;

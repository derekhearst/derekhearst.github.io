      Not to sound like a broken record but the island of Martinique is very
      beautiful, just like the rest of the islands we have been visiting.&nbsp;
      It has lots of mountains, green trees, friendly people, nice climate, but
      I guess the one thing it has more than any other island so far is the
      number of catamarans that are in the Le Marin anchorage.&nbsp; This
      anchorage is the home to six different charter companies and their
      inventory of catamarans is second to none, even more than what we saw in
      the BVIs.&nbsp; The anchorage is very protected and has every service for
      the boating industry that you could want, we have used a few of them as
      well.&nbsp; We did stop at the major harbor of Fort-de-France for a few
      days but the rolly anchorage was uncomfortable so we headed further south
      to Le Marin.<br />
      <br />
      The other thing this island/anchorage has is a boat called Day Dreamer and
      it&#39;s crew.&nbsp; Their crew includes three girls who have been also
      looking for another kid boat so they were very happy to have us come into
      the anchorage.&nbsp; We had met Day Dreamer last year in Charleston and
      hung out for a week or two and had a good time.&nbsp; Between the water
      and the sandy beach Derek and the girls from Day Dreamer have been having
      a great time.<br />
      <br />
      We have not done as much exploring on the island as we have on the others
      but what we has seen has been worth it.&nbsp; Many boaters that we talked
      to bypass the island because the language spoken here is French, very
      little English.&nbsp; We have not had any issues and have enjoyed
      listening to the conversations and wondering what they are talking
      about.&nbsp; The weather has been cloudy with a little rain most days, not
      enough that you are locked inside the boat but you have to make sure when
      you feel the first rain drops you get the hatches closed quickly.<br />
      <br />
      So far on the trip down we have been exposed to different currencies: US
      Dollars, DR peso, Euros, and Eastern Caribbean dollar.&nbsp; We have used
      the last two off and on over the last few islands so have not worried
      about how much inventory we still have.&nbsp; Now as we are getting ready
      to leave Martinique we do not want to carry too many Euros that will sit
      in our wallets until who knows when.&nbsp; The ATMs are very assessable so
      getting more is not the issue.&nbsp; Now it has taken some time to get use
      to the different color, size and look but it all spends the same.&nbsp;
      The exchange rates are different for each currency so some simple math is
      usually required to make sure you want to spend that amount on the
      product.<br />
      <br />
      The two major islands between us and Grenada are St. Lucia and St.
      Vincent.&nbsp; Both islands have some unique things on them but each have
      some issues with either clearing in/out or pesky boat boys.&nbsp; Will
      have to do more research and which anchorages we really want to stop
      at.<br />

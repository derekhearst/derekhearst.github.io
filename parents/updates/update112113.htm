      It was great to raise the anchor, clean the anchor chain, anchor bridle
      and motor out of the anchorage.&nbsp; It might not have been great to do
      the cleaning but it meant that the boat was moving and we were going to
      see some new spots.<br />
      <br />
      We decided to sail along the east coast of Grenada for a better wind
      angle.&nbsp; This meant fighting the winds for about 2 hours along the
      south side, but then a nice 6 hour sail north.&nbsp; In the past, we sail
      the west side, which is protected from the winds for the first 3 to 4
      hours, and then a harder slog into the winds for 3 to 4 hours.&nbsp; Along
      the south coast the waves were a bit bumpy but we thought that is would be
      an hour or so and then a great sail up to Carriacou.&nbsp; The sailboat
      Pollox was also going with us and with the sunny weather and 12 knots of
      wind looked promising.<br />
      <br />
      As we were rounding the island and finally got our sails up and were
      heading north we heard a bang and found that our port shroud broke at the
      top of the mast.&nbsp; There are 19 wires that make up the shroud and we
      had broken 13 of them so only 6 were holding the mast up.&nbsp; Only 3
      shrouds hold the mast to the boat so losing one really makes the mast
      unstable.&nbsp; Quickly we dropped all sails, and&nbsp; used our halyards
      to brace the mast hoping that we would not loose the mast overboard.&nbsp;
      It was a rather nervous time until all the halyards were positioned and
      supporting the mast.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a brief discussion and decided the
      best option was to head back to Hog Island were the waters were nice and
      calm, and get it fixed.&nbsp; We turned around and after a bit of nervous
      motoring, trying to keep the boat from any lateral rocking, we finally got
      anchored back at Hog Island.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pollux was nice enough to shadow
      us back to harbor to make sure we stayed safe, which was really nice of
      them.<br />
      <br />
      &nbsp;Once back, many friends came over with offers of help, and then
      helped us re-stabilize the rig, and then Kris went up the mast and removed
      the broken shroud.&nbsp;&nbsp; We took the broken shroud in, and got very
      lucky that the rigging store had the parts and wire needed, and were able
      make a new shroud for us.&nbsp; We decided to get the other shroud
      replaced as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      When the parts came in, our friends on Escape Velocity, which is also a
      Manta catamaran came over to assist us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris went up the mast
      installed the new shroud, then back down, and switch side, and then back
      up to install the other side.&nbsp; Jack and Marce on Escape Velocity were
      a great help. and after all was installed and properly adjusted, then we
      sent Derek up the mast to remove the last spare line.<br />
      <br />
      Now, we just have to leave again

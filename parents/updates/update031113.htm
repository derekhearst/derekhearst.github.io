      As we have been harbor hoping the southern coast of Puerto Rico we have
      spent about a week in the anchorage of Salinas.&nbsp; The anchorage is
      well protected from winds and waves and other than our Manatee encounter
      when we anchored (we startled a mother and her calf and they made a large
      splash which made the two people on the bow jump), it has been very
      relaxing.<br />
      <br />
      We decided for the weekend&nbsp; to use the Enterprise Car Weekend Rental
      of $10 per day for Friday/Sat/Sun, to tour Puerto Rico via the
      roads.&nbsp; We drove 275 miles.&nbsp; The trip from Salinas to San Juan
      was over several mountains; the island is very hilly, but the major road
      was 4 lanes so no problems.&nbsp; On the trip we went from a small town -
      to no town - and then into the biggest town of San Juan with over 3
      million people.<br />
      <br />
      We wanted to go into Old San Juan and since parking is hard to find we
      took a parking garage approach.&nbsp; The procedure we found is to park a
      car in the normal stall and then attendants park cars in front of the
      stalls thereby blocking the stalls.&nbsp; The cars blocking the stalls
      leave their keys in the car so if the car in the stall needs out the
      parking attendant just moves the car in front.&nbsp; This allows for a lot
      more cars in the garage but is rather confusing to an inexperienced parker
      and trying to communicate this in broken English/Spanish adds for an extra
      confusion.<br />
      <br />
      The area in Old San Juan is beautiful and has private homes, businesses
      and several large public buildings.&nbsp; One of the buildings we walked
      through had several guitar groups scattered around it.&nbsp; Each group
      was involved in lessons and the one group we watched were children
      learning on 10 string guitars.&nbsp; You could tell the groups where the
      lessons were more advanced vs. the beginning lessons after listen for a
      short time.<br />
      <br />
      We walked up the walkway to &quot;El Morro&quot;, the fort at the entrance
      to San Juan harbor, then read the signs referring to all the Dutch and
      French soldiers who tried to take the fort over the 250 years of the
      fort&#39;s history, none were successful.&nbsp; The Spanish had built the
      fort because it was on the first major island from Europe with fresh
      water, shelter, supplies, and a deep water harbor .&nbsp; The fort is now
      part of the National Park Service; has been kept up well and has lots of
      history you can learn.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We stopped and had Wendy&#39;s for lunch in Old San Juan, and just outside
      the restaurant was a large public square with benches and statues.&nbsp;
      There were a couple of hundred pigeons about the square and Derek wanted
      to run through them, but we didn&#39;t let him.&nbsp; A lady came over and
      grabbed Derek&#39;s hand and dumped some bird seed in it and before he
      knew it, two pigeons had landed on his arm and were busy eating.&nbsp; She
      did the same to Kris, and they both had a grand time pretending to be
      statues as the birds ate out of their hands.&nbsp; Thankfully, no one got
      bird poo on them.<br />
      <br />
      Since we have not been driving much; the experience of driving in Old San
      Juan was an adventure as well.&nbsp; The streets are narrow, one way with
      cars parked on one side.&nbsp; Most of the roads are paved with blue
      bricks,&nbsp; and are very hilly.&nbsp; The map we had from the rental car
      agency and the old GPS map did not always agree on the routes so we might
      have seen several of the same streets as we tried to find our route from
      point A to point B.&nbsp; There were no fender benders and when we finally
      drove out of San Juan to the wider roads we were happy.&nbsp; On the way
      home we stopped at a Costco and reloaded up some of our supplies, felt
      just like the USA.<br />
      <br />
      On Sunday we drove up into the hills in the central part of Puerto Rico,
      around Villalba.&nbsp; These roads are called two lanes but usually 1.5
      wide.&nbsp; We had to detour several times around bicycle events, one
      serious race and two local town parades.&nbsp; The hills make the roads
      very twisty and slow, usually 30 mph as you weave and wind up and down the
      hills.&nbsp; We stopped and looked at a water fall along the road and then
      went it to a coffee plantation and took a self-guided tour.&nbsp; This
      plantation has 120 acres of coffee, mid size for the island, and uses one
      person per acre to harvest coffee.&nbsp; Very labor intensive but when you
      see the slope people have to walk on you can understand the ratio.<br />
      <br />
      It was good to see more of Puerto Rico than just from the water but we
      were very happy to get back on the boat.&nbsp;

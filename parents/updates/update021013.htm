      We left the Turks and Caicos with a weather window forecasted for light NE
      winds.&nbsp; Along the way we got to see a &quot;mating dance&quot;
      between two humpback whales.&nbsp; It was very spectacular with at least
      80% of the whale coming out of the water - Quite a sight.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We were aimed for Puerto Rico, but ended up in the Dominican
      Republic.&nbsp;We know this because like in the movie &quot;Captain
      Ron&quot; when we arrived we &quot;just stop and asked&nbsp;
      directions&quot;.&nbsp; O.K. so we weren&#39;t lost, just did not end up
      where we had planned to go, but are really happy that it happened that
      way.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan, which can always change, was to make the east
      end of PR but the waves and winds made us rethink that and we ended up
      sailing into Samana Bay and staying at Marina Puerto Bahia.&nbsp; At just
      .90 cents per foot, it was quite reasonable, and since Customs,
      Immigration and the Navy representative were on had, quite easy to check
      in and be legal in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp; The marina is very nice, and
      it is part of a resort that is quite pricey, however as marina guests, we
      got to use all of the facilities that the rich folks did.&nbsp; Two
      infinity pools, exercise room, concierge.&nbsp; We got a free taxi ride
      into town, as the resort is about 2 miles outside of town.&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      The taxi was&nbsp; a pickup with crew cab.&nbsp; We were going with our
      friends on Good Trade, so there were 4 adults and two kids, however the
      kids are the same size as Kris.&nbsp; Dean got the front seat being the
      largest, and the other five got the back, with Derek on Kris&#39; lap, and
      two people sitting in the middle of the backseat where the cushion was
      torn and sagged down about a foot lower than the rest of the seat.&nbsp;
      We made it to town just fine, and wandered the touristy part just briefly,
      and then headed off to the non-tourist area.&nbsp; Found a local grocery
      and got a few items, then off to lunch at a small restaurant where all the
      locals ate.&nbsp; Two pieces of fried chicken, rice and lentil soup for
      just under $5 per person.&nbsp; The food was delicious.&nbsp; We were all
      getting some really good practice with our Spanish.<br />
      <br />
      After lunch we headed to the farmers market to buy some fruits and
      veggies, and had a great time with the locals naming the items and asking
      for prices.&nbsp; We got instruction on preparation and the nice lady even
      gave us some stuff for free.&nbsp; They had a great time trying to teach
      Kris how to say cinnamon in Spanish correctly, and after about 8 tries she
      finally got it right and there were high 5&#39;s all around.&nbsp; Derek
      did good asking prices, but then the lady quizzed him later and he got all
      tongue tied.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady and her husband that we got our produce
      from, flagged a taxi for us for the return trip - but this taxi was a
      little different.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      There are lots and lots of motorcycles used for transportation here, but
      most would not be street legal in the United States.&nbsp; They attach a
      two wheel cart that would seat 4 normally to the motorcycle and that is
      the taxi.&nbsp; We got all 6 of us plus groceries in one cart, and off we
      went.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dominican Republic is very mountainous and we
      had a very steep hill to climb to get back.&nbsp; The guy on the
      motorcycle towing us was overworking his poor motorcycle to pull us up the
      hill.&nbsp; At one point half of us got out and walked up a small steeper
      portion, and then we all got back in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other motorcycles
      came up behind us, and one put his foot on the back of the cart and helped
      push us up the hill while on his motorcycle.&nbsp; At one point Dean and
      Ross got off to help push as well.&nbsp; When we took off, Ross got back
      in, but Dean was left behind - no problemo, one of the other guys on the
      motorcycle following picked up Dean and brought him along.&nbsp;&nbsp; It
      was all to no avail though because halfway up the hill the motorcycle died
      completely - probably never to run again.&nbsp; NO PROBLEM, the guy
      pushing with his foot, hooked us up to his bike and we continued
      on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone along the side of the road was staring at us and
      could not believe the gringos scrunched into this little cart and the
      motorcycle whining at a high pitch trying to get us up the
      hill.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a case of the tourists becoming the
      attraction.&nbsp;&nbsp; We gave the second taxi driver $10 and he was
      thrilled with that.&nbsp; Don&#39;t know if he was going to split it with
      the first guy with the broken bike or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      So far we have found everyone here very very pleasant and nice and had
      really enjoyed our time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More on the Dominican Republic
      later.

      It was to only be one week but since it was a great success the
      &quot;Kid&#39;s Holiday Week&quot; went on for two weeks.&nbsp; Toni and
      Barry two crew from South Africa had taught activities like this before so
      with them willing and the the kids eager the second week was off and
      running.&nbsp; Each day the kids who ranged from 4 to 13 spent time
      learning about recycling, medicine, sand sculpture, sailboat
      building/racing, hiked the island, made lunch, and overall played
      hard.&nbsp; The day began at 8:30 am and lasted until 12:30 or 1 depending
      upon how the activity was going.&nbsp; Needless to say, the kids were all
      tired by the time lunch came around.<br />
      <br />
      After lunch it seemed like Derek and the girls off Day Dreamer hit their
      second wind and usually the afternoon was full of playing in the water and
      land.&nbsp; By the time 5 p.m. rolled around, Derek was usually hungry,
      tired, and just wanted to sit down and do nothing.<br />
      <br />
      Kris has taken up the &quot;noodling&quot; activity in the morning.&nbsp;
      This involves taking a long Styrofoam float (noodle)&nbsp; and exercising
      in the water with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a group of 8 to 12 ladies that
      start at 8:15 and exercise for an hour here in Hog Island anchorage.&nbsp;
      The activity can be as easy or as hard as you want to make it.&nbsp; It is
      important not to have a worn out noodle that has been in the sun and
      gotten rough, because as Kris found out, a rough noodle can cause some
      serious noodle burns when used between the legs for bicycling
      exercise.&nbsp; Kris has a brand new smooth noodle now!<br />
      <br />
      While this is all going on Dean has taken Sam off to explore the island or
      find where the roads lead.&nbsp; Even though it is early morning the warm
      weather does make Sam a bit tired and by the time they are back on the
      boat Sam is ready for a long nap.<br />
      <br />
      After noodling and Sam&#39;s walk, we try to do a boat project or clean up
      and then usually take the afternoon off to do important things like
      reading and napping.&nbsp;

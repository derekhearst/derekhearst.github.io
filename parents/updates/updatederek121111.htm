				<p class="style9">Christmas is coming and I am not sure what I 
				want, this is a problem.&nbsp; It is driving me crazy, not sure 
				what I really want.&nbsp; The normal toys are too easy and the 
				expensive computer stuff is too much money so I am trying to 
				find something that is more me that I will play with for a long 
				time.</p>
				<p class="style9">The fish story.&nbsp; So I have been trying to 
				catch a fish since we left Connecticut but have not been 
				successful until now.&nbsp; So I decided to go fishing because I 
				was bored of Mine Craft and we did not have internet.&nbsp; So I 
				got out the pole and reel and started casting and reeling, no 
				luck.&nbsp; My mom suggested using a bobber and orange fish 
				stuff and 15 minutes later the pole bent and I yelled to my mom 
				&quot;I caught a fish I caught a fish&quot;.&nbsp; My mom came over and 
				she said reel it in and I said I am I am.&nbsp; After adjusting 
				the drag tension I was able to reel it in.&nbsp; When I got it 
				close enough we got the net out and mom was able to net it.&nbsp; 
				We got the fish on board and identified it as a cat fish, not 
				one that was good to eat.&nbsp; Dad took out the hook and we let 
				it go back into the water.&nbsp; I was so excited I could not 
				stop walking around the boat and saying &quot;I caught a fish, I 
				caught a fish&quot;.</p>

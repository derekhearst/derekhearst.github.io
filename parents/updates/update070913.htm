      It is hurricane season and the first hurricane/tropical storm that is
      close to Grenada has been named Chantal.&nbsp; We have watched several
      develop that were west and north of us and did not worry about them.&nbsp;
      There must be over 100 cruisers here in Grenada anchored out and the
      weather is a big part of the cruiser&#39;s VHF radio net in the
      morning.&nbsp; Now that Chantal is coming closer the weather information
      and discussion has increased to two or three times each day.<br />
      <br />
      With the internet there are many sites you can look at from NOAA to the
      one Kris found the other day that gives up to 30 different tracking
      models,
      <a href="http://tropicalatlantic.com/models/">
        http://tropicalatlantic.com/models/</a
      >.&nbsp; From all reports it looks like the hurricane will pass north of
      us, the only question is how far North.&nbsp; The winds are showing up to
      40 miles per hour sixty miles from the center so we are hoping the center
      will pass at least 90 miles away.<br />
      <br />
      Today was the first day of &quot;kids holiday week&quot; on the beach here
      at Hog Island.&nbsp; The event is open to all kids and is held from 8 am
      to 12 noon for the entire week.&nbsp; There were over 20 kids there today,
      and not all that are here were able to make it today, hopefully they will
      be able to for the rest of the week.&nbsp; It might rain a bit over the
      next couple of days due to the storm but tomorrow the kids are using
      snorkeling gear so I do not think rain will interrupt that activity.<br />
      <br />
      So for the time being we will watch the weather, play on the beach, and
      maybe squeeze in a nap or two just so we are not too tired.<br />
      <br />
      Kris got fed up with how long her hair was, especially with the hot
      weather, and finally got so fed up she asked Dean to cut it.&nbsp; Well
      ---- hair grows, and she owns hats.&nbsp; Really it is not that bad, at
      least it is shorter, and with the wind blowing all the time, you really
      can&#39;t tell what someone&#39;s hairstyle is anyway. <br />

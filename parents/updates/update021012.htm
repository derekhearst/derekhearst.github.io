      As we mentioned in the last article we found out that one of our
      propellers was not on the shaft.&nbsp; With one engine having a working
      propeller we were able to anchor with out too much problem, but for long
      term cruising we needed to fix it.&nbsp; At Black Point we had good
      internet access so after Kris did a ton of research and talked to many
      Volvo suppliers we came to find out the 2 bladed folding prop that we had,
      and is shown in the picture is no longer being made.<br />
      <br />
      Our choices were to upgrade to a three bladed folding prop or go with a
      two bladed fixed, second picture.&nbsp; The cost lead us to the fixed
      prop.&nbsp; Not sure if we would have an issue with two propellers not
      matching so we went ahead and ordered two of the fixed props. <br />
      <br />
      There is a company in Fort Lauderdale, Watermakers Air, that makes daily
      trips out to Staniel Cay and will bring out parts when they have
      room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were able to order the parts on Wednesday, and
      Thursday morning they were in Ft. Lauderdale, and by Thursday afternoon
      they were in the Bahamas at Staniel Cay, 5 miles north of us.&nbsp; Dean
      made a&nbsp; 30 minute trip in the dingy to pick up the part.&nbsp; Well
      we did not have enough gas to motor there so paid $35 for 5 gallons of
      gas.&nbsp; With that Dean was able to make a fast trip up and back with
      the new propellers.&nbsp; Also refilled the gas in case we have any other
      trips to make.<br />
      <br />
      Now normally to work on the boat you either haul the boat in a boat yard
      or scuba on the boat.&nbsp; Another option is to &quot;beach&quot; the
      boat at close to high tide and when the tide is out you can work on the
      boat until the next high tide.&nbsp; This works great with a catamaran as
      long as you have enough tide and a nice soft sandy beach.&nbsp; Since we
      do not have a local boat yard and our snorkeling would not work we decided
      to &quot;beach&quot; the boat.&nbsp; We marked out our prime location and
      moved the boat into position, that sounds easier than it is.&nbsp; With
      both bow and stern anchors and a bit of help from the dingy we were in
      position for the tide to go out.<br />
      <br />
      Putting the new propeller on the empty shaft went quick, 5 minutes or
      so.&nbsp; On the second shaft we had to take off the old, a bit of elbow
      grease and hammer worked well but took a bit more time.&nbsp; In the end
      we were able to mount two new fixed propellers on the boat prior to the
      tide coming back in.&nbsp; In fact Dean was able to apply some new bottom
      paint at the water line as well.&nbsp; The bottom paint comes off as you
      clean the boat so normally every two years you need to reapply the
      paint.<br />
      <br />
      In the pictures of our boat, it doesn&quot;t look very far out of the
      water, but it was, we did not take pictures till we were done with all the
      work, and by then the tide was coming back in - sorry.<br />
      <br />
      You never know what adventure is ahead of you, but we are happy to have
      this one behind us, and lots of good lessons learned.<br />

            You&nbsp; can see we are in shallow water - the water is waist high
            on Derek.&nbsp; Usually the water is up to the top of the green on
            the bottom of boat.

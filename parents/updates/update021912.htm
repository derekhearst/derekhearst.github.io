				At long last we made it to wonderful George Town, one of the 
				biggest towns in the Exumas.&nbsp; It is at the southern end of 
				Great Exumas Island and is a very popular hang out for cruisers.&nbsp; 
				The layout is handy for there is an island on the eastern side 
				which offers protection from the northerly and easterly winds.&nbsp; 
				These are the most typical winds so unless some major storm 
				comes through the protection is great.&nbsp; On the island there 
				is also a small mooring field but 95% of the boats are anchored 
				out.&nbsp; Oh by the way there are currently 300 boats here in 
				George Town.<br />
				The area is set up to support the needs of the cruiser as well.&nbsp; 
				Starting around 2 in the afternoon there are 3 to 4 volleyball 
				games that get going, from beginning levels to more advanced.&nbsp; 
				There is tile rummy, baseball, weaving, checker, art, yoga, and if you want 
				to start any specific activity you will find more interest than 
				you want.&nbsp; <br />
				At the end of February/start of March there is a big week long cruiser regatta, 
				well it probably more of an excuse to have a party.&nbsp;It 
				isn&#39;t just sailboat racing, but all sorts of activities from 
				scavenger hunts, sand castle building, volleyball tournaments, 
				golf, poker, dinghy races and pet parades.&nbsp; If you can not find something to 
				interest you then you are in trouble.<br />
				<br />
				The town has offered several dingy docks, free 
				water, free garbage disposal, gas and diesel dock, and today the 
				propane truck came by.&nbsp; Well the line was only 60 bottles 
				long and at 5 minutes per tank it took awhile to get your tank 
				filled but they do come around every week - so waiting every now 
				and then isn&#39;t too big an issue.&nbsp; There is a major grocery 
				story and then several smaller ones around.&nbsp; Oso was having an ear itch and so we went to the local vet, an 
				American who &quot;retired&quot; down here.&nbsp; Most of the cruisers 
				come back year after year and many travel from the states/Canada 
				and make this their winter home. <br />
				<br />
&nbsp;Derek has been feeding the local ray that lives right off the beach, the 
				folks that make the Conch Salads throw there left over&#39;s to the 
				ray so it is very friendly.<br />
				<br />
				It is quite the area here, all the cruisers are very friendly 
				and nice.&nbsp; There still aren&#39;t many kids, but Derek has 
				found some almost every day to play with, but oddly enough, the 
				kids we first met when arriving in the Bahamas, as still the 
				ones we see most often.&nbsp; Other cruisers say that there are 
				not many kids this year as compared to the past.<br />

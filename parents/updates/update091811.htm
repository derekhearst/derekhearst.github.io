      It went fast, it seems like just yesterday we came to Annapolis and now a
      week and half later we are leaving.&nbsp; The day we arrived was the last
      big sailboat race of the year and there were sailboats everywhere.&nbsp;
      As we left today there is another sailboat race going on and it is
      exciting to see all the boats and spinnakers flying.&nbsp; Kind of makes
      us want to make our boat go faster but with our &quot;house&quot; it just
      does not perform at the level of the go fast racing boats.&nbsp; Oh well
      Kris is having hot tea, Derek is playing a WII game, and I am typing on
      the computer.<br />
      &nbsp;We did our tourist things here, walked downtown, took a walking tour
      of the Naval Academy, and even spent a rainy day at the town mall.&nbsp;
      It is quite amazing how many sailboats are here.&nbsp; There are a lot of
      sailboat races, and some of&nbsp; the racing sailboats get hauled out of
      the water between races. There looks to be several boats where people live
      aboard, and quite a few of us transients. There are also lots of
      businesses that cater to sailors, so supplies are fairly easy to
      find.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also found a large grocery and laundromat about a
      mile away, so took care of those chores.<br />
      Annapolis have a big boat show the first weekend of October, and the
      anchorage was starting to fill up already.&nbsp; After the boat show, all
      the boats head south and it gets harder to find anchorages that are not
      crowded after that, so we wanted to get south before the crowd.<br />
      We ordered our water maker and a new alternator as we found after 5 days
      of cloud and rain, the solar just can&#39;t keep&nbsp; up.&nbsp; All the
      items will take another week before they arrive in Annapolis, so we might
      as well head to Washington D.C. and when it all comes in we can bus over
      to Annapolis, or rent a car and pick it all up.<br />
      We met a nice Australian couple that have been out for over 6 years on
      their trawler &quot;Argos&quot;.&nbsp; There were also several boats from
      Canada, and one from Holland in our anchorage area.<br />
      A boat next to us had two cats on board, and woke up one morning and one
      was missing. We hope they find him, as there is a good chance it has
      hidden out on shore for a while.&nbsp; Made me glad though that our cat
      Sackett is safely on land with Grandma and Grandpa.<br />
      We had a good sail today, 9/17/11, down to the Solomons, MD.&nbsp; The
      only problem is it is 70 degrees and Kris is cold, has on her pants, tee
      shirt, sweatshirt, and a blanket and says we need to head future south
      where it is warm.

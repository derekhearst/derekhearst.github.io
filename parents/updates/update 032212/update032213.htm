          >, March 15th, is best known as the date on which Julius Caesar was
          killed in 44 B.C. Caesar was stabbed (23 times) to death in the Roman
          Senate by a group of 60 other co-conspirators led by Marcus Junius
          Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus.&nbsp; We did not have that much
          excitement but between Derek&#39;s birthday and the end of the George
          Town Cruiser Regatta we kept busy.<br />
          <br />
          The end of the Regatta saw the mighty sand sculpture and the
          volleyball tournament.&nbsp; Derek participated with two other boats
          and made a large sea turtle that took 1st place.&nbsp; It was a good
          10 feet long and 5 feet wide.&nbsp; Dean tried his hand in volleyball
          and while he had fun his team did not do as well as Derek&#39;s.&nbsp;
          The Regatta kept the area hopping with events and cruisers
          participation.&nbsp; After the Regatta many boats started their
          travels onward so the anchorage has fewer boats now.&nbsp; Dean&#39;s
          brother and family are due in the 1st week of April so after their
          visit it will be time for our exit as well.<br />
          <br />
          Derek&#39;s 12th birthday came on the 13th so Kris arranged for a
          group of the kids get together and also made a cake.&nbsp; This was
          the first birthday we had issues of sand getting into the food.&nbsp;
          Derek&#39;s big birthday gift was to go scuba diving.&nbsp; A local
          dive shop offers a introductory dive for beginners and Derek was able
          to use all the equipment and go down 20 feet.&nbsp; All in all he was
          in the water for a good 45 minutes and now wants more time in the
          water.<br />
          <br />
          The weather has continued to be very mild, the days in the mid 70s to
          low 80&#39;s and the nights high 60s.&nbsp; We talked to a local who
          said the water will warm up from the current 72 to low 80s during the
          summer.&nbsp;

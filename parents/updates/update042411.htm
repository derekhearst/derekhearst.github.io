				It is only the end of April but the time is running faster and 
				the projects seem to take longer.&nbsp; We were able to get all 
				the solar panels mounted and wired to the electrical cabinet.&nbsp; 
				The final hook up will be this week after we get a couple of 
				wire ends narrowed so they will fit into the Blue Sky 
				controller.<br />
				<br />
				The plumbing is basically done except for 8 hose clamps that 
				need to be attached.&nbsp; The new plumbing lines should keep 
				the boat from smelling and the routing of the lines is simpler 
				in case of issues in the future.<br />
				<br />
				We had brought the dingy to our house over the winter and Kris 
				has been attempting to make dingy chaps.&nbsp; Our dingy is an 
				Avon S3.40 supersport, and is old and used.&nbsp; The thought 
				was making the chaps would help protect the dingy but we have 
				been waiting on the material and so it sits.&nbsp; We knew there 
				were a couple of leaks and today we identified them and patched 
				them.&nbsp; With the dingy being old we know there are some pin 
				holes, slow leaks, and so we had bought some Tuff Coat that will 
				help fill the holes and also offer additional protection.<br />
				<br />
				Next weekend we are thinking of testing the engines prior to 
				launching the boat.&nbsp; Kris has worked on one engine and on 
				the other sail drive so prior to going in the water we want to 
				make sure there are no issues, do not plan on any but cheaper to 
				check it now vs. having to pull the boat later.</div>

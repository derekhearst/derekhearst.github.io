      Do you know that saying &quot;measure twice, cut once&quot;?&nbsp; Well
      there should be an addition to that &quot;if there are marks on the object
      then use a different color to mark the length&quot;.&nbsp; So working on
      the additional alternator that we added there is a bolt that is too long
      for all the adjustment to be made, simple enough to just cut the eye
      bolt.&nbsp; Mark the bolt, take the next 30 minutes to hacksaw it, put it
      back on and find out it is too short.&nbsp; Ok just get a new eye bolt and
      try again, well this eye bolt is a &quot;high strength ball joint rod
      end&quot; and there are a special order for the local businesses.&nbsp; Ok
      the next option is to find McMaster Carr phone number, order a new one and
      hope it gets in prior to leaving the anchorage, the next day.&nbsp; It did
      and the uncut/full length and working fine.&nbsp; Another valuable lesson
      learned on the &quot;What If&quot; :).<br />
      <br />
      We stopped at Cumberland Island which is the southern most island in
      Georgia and is a state park and has a wild horse population.&nbsp; We
      sailed overnight from Beaufort SC and came into the anchorage in the early
      morning, 7:30am and promptly went to sleep for the next few hours.&nbsp;
      Well Dean and Kris did because they had been up for the sailing part but
      Derek was all rested and ready for a new day.&nbsp; By noon we were all
      ready to go ashore and walk the park, the dogs included.&nbsp; The horses
      were seen from the boat, and on shore we saw the horses as well.&nbsp;
      They look like any other horse - well a horse is a horse of course of
      course.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We then went down the ICW to the Kingsley Plantation, a state park in
      Florida, we finally made it to Florida and the sun was shinning and the
      temperature was warm :).&nbsp; The plantation was educational to walk
      around and learn about the activities of the plantation.&nbsp; Bob off
      Baloo has some eagle eyes and as we motored down the ICW would point out
      Bald Eagles and Manatee, we could spot the dolphins but the Manatees were
      hard to spot.<br />
      <br />
      The next stop was only 30 miles down the ICW but we wanted to have an easy
      trip into St. Augustine so this stop was in preparation for the next
      day.&nbsp; But not to let a good thing go unused Anne on Baloo made a
      turkey dinner and Kris made mashed potatoes, biscuits, and an pineapple
      upside down cake.&nbsp; The group did not go hungry and then we were in
      good shape to play UNO attack, not sure who won but we sure had a good
      time playing.<br />
      <br />
      Yesterday we made the short hop into St. Augustine, FL and anchored in the
      river.&nbsp; There will be laundry, shopping, a trip to West Marine for
      parts for the water maker, a trip to the Volvo ship store for oil filters
      and a general wandering around town to look at the Spanish influenced
      architecture.&nbsp; Right off our anchor is
      <span class="style1"
        >Fort &quot;Castillo de San Marcos&quot; which is the oldest masonry
        fort in the US, and they fire cannon</span
      >s and muskets through out the day as they give tours of the fort.<br />

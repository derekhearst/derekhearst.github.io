				On land, the changes in weather and wind are not watched as 
				closely as when you are 
				on the water and are trying to find a good protected safe 
				anchorage.&nbsp; In the U.S. waters there is the NOAA forecasts 
				that you can listen to on the VHF.&nbsp; They are updated 
				several times during the day and usually you can pick up on one 
				either to your north or south so you have a good general idea on 
				what is going on.&nbsp; The forecast also gives good information 
				on the wave height or sea conditions.<br />
				<br />
				As we have traveled away from the U.S. we have&nbsp; had to find 
				other methods for getting weather.&nbsp; A lot of boaters have Single 
				Side Band (SSB) radios and can listen to different broadcasts, 
				the most popular is Chris Parker on 4045 at 6:30 am.&nbsp; Chris will 
				give a&nbsp; forecast for the Bahamas and the Caribbean 6 
				days a week.&nbsp; He uses several models to help him predict 
				the weather and if you want you can have him give you a specific 
				forecast for your boat/area.<br />
				<br />
				When we have had internet we use several sources, Passage 
				Weather, Bahamas weather, Wind Finder,&nbsp; and Weather 
				Underground.&nbsp; The nice thing about weather predictions is 
				they usually do not agree.&nbsp; Take for instance the other day 
				we left from Spanish Wells heading north to the Abacos.&nbsp; 
				The weather reports were for light winds under 15 knots from the south and 
				broken cloud cover.&nbsp; As we left Spanish Wells it looked 
				promising and after 3 hours under way we realized the weather 
				was not following the predictions.&nbsp; The &quot;squall&quot; 
				with 25 to 30 knots of wind&nbsp; lasted 3 
				hours and the winds were out of&nbsp; the east with heavy rain and some thunder, of 
				course the lighting did not help our outlook.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We made it up to the Abacos without &quot;trouble&quot; but would have 
				preferred the original weather forecast.&nbsp;

				Traveling through New York Harbor on the water has been enjoyable and 
				exciting.&nbsp; The trip from Long Island Sound starts with 
				going under the Throgs Neck Bridge, the timing of this is most 
				critical.&nbsp; As you go along the East river you get to a spot 
				called &quot;Hells Gate&quot;.&nbsp; At this spot you can have a 
				current of 4 to 5 knots, hopefully going in the direction 
				you are; otherwise the trip takes a lot longer.<br />
				<br />
				So by studying the tide tables you are able to time the journey 
				to coincide with favorable current.&nbsp; On the travel you go 
				under 10 bridges (of course one is the Brooklyn Bridge), ending 
				with the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge at the entrance to New York 
				harbor from the Atlantic Ocean.&nbsp; You also get to view 
				LaGuardia Airport,<span class="st"> Manhattan/downtown New York, 
				and that heliport in downtown NY that you see in so many movies.&nbsp; 
				Of course, the Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan skyline, and 
				on occasion the Queen Elizabeth II.&nbsp; There are a multitude of islands with the big ones being; Rikers 
				Island (home of New York&#39;s main jail complex), Roosevelt Island, 
				Governors Island, Liberty Island, and Ellis Island.&nbsp; There 
				are also all the buildings, some old and others like the new 
				Trade Center that are still being built.<br />
				<br />
				With all that there is also the boat traffic, some going up and 
				down the East River but as you get into Manhattan the ferry boat 
				traffic, the tour boats, and water taxis make the passage rather 
				bumpy of a ride.<br />
				<br />
				For the four hours it takes you to travel down the East river 
				and out to the Atlantic it is one of the most diverse and 
				interesting trips.</span></div>

				We sailed/motored out to Ocracoke on Tuesday and will eventually 
				leave, maybe on Saturday/Sunday the winds will help us.<p class="style2" align="left">
				The island of Ocracoke is part of the Outer Banks of North 
				Carolina. It is the last inhabited island, from north to south, 
				of the Outer Banks, and can only be reached by one of three 
				public ferries (two of which are toll ferries), private boat, or 
				private plane. Other than the village of Ocracoke and a few 
				other areas (a campground, a pony pen, a small runway), the 
				entire island is part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. A 
				single two lane road, NC 12, runs from the village at the 
				southern end of the island to the ferry dock at the northern tip 
				of the island, where a free ferry connects to Hatteras Island. 
				The second ferry dock, located in the village, has toll 
				connections to Swan Quarter, North Carolina on the mainland and 
				Cedar Island, near Atlantic Beach, North Carolina.</p>
				The village of Ocracoke is located around a small sheltered 
				harbor called Silver Lake, with a second smaller residential 
				area built around a series of man-made canals called Oyster 
				Creek. The village is located at the widest point of the island, 
				protected from the Atlantic Ocean by sand dunes and a salt 
				marsh. The average height of the island is less than five feet 
				above sea level, and flooding is a problem during hurricanes and 
				large storms, and many of the buildings on the island are built 
				on pilings to lift them off the ground. The Ocracoke Lighthouse, 
				one of North America&#39;s oldest lighthouses, is situated near 
				Silver Lake.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
				We went out on Friday and walked the 1 1/2 mile to the beach to 
				fly kites and play in the surf.&nbsp; Not much surf time because 
				there were warnings for severe rip tides and the water was cold.&nbsp; 
				The winds were blowing 20 ish so the kite flying was good and 
				the sand was blowing down the beach making more dunes as we 
				watched.&nbsp; It is a nice island and you can get around town 
				with out too much effort although Derek still thinks it would be 
				fun to rent a golf cart, bike, or other vehicle to see the 
				sites.<br />
				<br />
				The mosquitoes have been quite ferocious, a leftover effect from 
				the hurricane and the amount of water it dumped. We all have red 
				lumps on our legs arms and necks.&nbsp; Getting an ice cream 
				cone in the afternoons seems to help with the itching :).<br />

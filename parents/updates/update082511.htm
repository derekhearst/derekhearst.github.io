				It seems like this trip has started with strange weather.&nbsp; 
				We left Block Island with 25 knots of wind and seas of 2 to 4 
				feet.&nbsp; Ok that was fine and the boat did well.&nbsp; We 
				left Bridgeport a day later than thought because the rain was 
				dumping but that was ok too.&nbsp; We anchored at Staten Island 
				at the Great Kills Bay and night after night watched lighting 
				storms come close, none too close so we said it has to get 
				better.&nbsp; The last night at Barnegat Bay treated us to winds 
				of 30+ but by morning had slowed to 15, the seas were rough but 
				we had a good sail to Cape May, NY.&nbsp; Now we thought the 
				weather is on our side.<br />
				<br />
				We planned on leaving Cape May on 8/25 to head up into the upper 
				Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp; Now with the impact of<span class="style1"> 
				Irene</span> the hurricane that is coming 
				up the east coast we really need to be out of Cape May.&nbsp; 
				So we left with a Small Craft advisory and seas 3 to 5, winds 
				of 25 to 30.&nbsp; After a few hours we got into the middle of the Delaware River 
				and things 
				mellowed out except for the rain storms that came through.&nbsp; 
				When is the weather going to be on our side?<br />
				<br />
				Oh yea let&#39;s not for get about the earthquake as well.&nbsp; We 
				were in the Cape May visitor center when the building started to 
				move.&nbsp; At first we thought it was our sea legs playing a 
				trick but when the pictures started to move we knew better.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Our plan to wait out the hurricane is to anchor in the 
				Sassafras River, upper Chesapeake.&nbsp; This will be our first, 
				hopefully our last but doubtful, and so not sure what to expect.&nbsp; 
				Some forecasts are the hurricane will miss the coast and just 
				hit Connecticut and other reports show it coming inland.&nbsp; 
				One of the reports we listened to said 50 to 60 knots of wind 
				and 5 to7 foot seas, that would be on the coast.&nbsp; Our hopes 
				are lots of rain and a little wind, 10 to 20 would be ok.<br />
				<br />
				8/27/11&nbsp; hurricane plans update<br />
				I guess the other weather becomes very minor compared to the 
				upcoming hurricane.&nbsp; We are now headed back up the 
				Chesapeake and Delaware Cannel to Summit North Marina, it is by 
				Bear Delaware.&nbsp; They are forecasting 4 to 6 foot 
				waves/surge and winds up to 60 on Sunday.&nbsp; This marina is 
				noted as a hurricane anchorage so we are hoping for the best.&nbsp; 
				Will let you know more as we get internet.<br />

				We have sailed a few time and if you look at the instruments 
				with 23 knots of wind we were moving at 7.3 knots, that is also 
				with a single reef in the main (just for all you sailing folks 
				:))<br />

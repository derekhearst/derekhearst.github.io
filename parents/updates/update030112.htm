				Naming a boat can&nbsp; be a real problem sometimes.&nbsp; It is 
				rumored to be bad luck if you change the name of a boat unless 
				you put a penny under the mast or follow other &quot;Tribute to 
				Neptune&quot; measures.&nbsp; Most people do change the name of the 
				boat when they buy it and name her something that has special 
				meaning to them.&nbsp; For instance we named our boat &quot;What If&quot; 
				because it seemed like Derek was always asking that question, 
				what if I could walk on water, what if we could fly, what if we 
				could jump 20 feet, etc....&nbsp; The other thing you have to be 
				prepared to do is answer the question &quot;Why did you name your 
				boat______&quot; because as you are traveling others are curious as 
				well.&nbsp; One of the other issue to be aware of is when you 
				use the VHF radio other boats will be calling your boat name and 
				usually saying the name 3 times in a row.&nbsp; So if your name 
				is a tongue twister people might not call you or they might just 
				make up a different version.&nbsp; So you can see by the 
				pictures there are a wide variety of names out there and many 
				stories to be told.<br />
				<br />
				The other item that is fun to pay attention to is where do all 
				the boats come from.&nbsp; Not only what nationality are they 
				but for those that come out of the US what states are they from.&nbsp; 
				With us being on the East Coast the majority of boats are from 
				the east and the most popular state by far is Florida.&nbsp; 
				Some folks will come over from Florida for 3 to 4 months and 
				then go back to their land based home.&nbsp; Have seen boats 
				from Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Texas, New Hampshire, 
				Connecticut, New York,&nbsp; North Carolina, just to name a few.&nbsp; 
				There are many many boats out of Canada, I guess coming down to 
				the sunny warm Bahamas sure beats the cold snowy conditions of 
				Quebec, Toronto and Montreal.&nbsp; We have meet several folks 
				from Australia on sailboats and power boats.&nbsp; Some have 
				left from Australia and made it this far, some bought their 
				boats on the east coast, as the Aussie dollar is much better 
				than ours right now.&nbsp; One family we moet is from 
				Switzerland and the father had to make an emergency trip back 
				home when their home water pipes broke in the cold weather.&nbsp; 
				Talk about a weather shock to the system going from the sunny 
				warm weather here to Switzerland, oh yea when you start to 
				cruise one of the first things you eliminate is all that extra 
				warm clothing that you have, oops - he had to buy a jacket at 
				the airport.<br />

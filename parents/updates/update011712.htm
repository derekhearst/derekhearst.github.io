      You might ask what do all three of these have in common, well it is they
      are all hear at Staniel Cay in the Exumas and we have been swimming
      with/near all of them.&nbsp; Now I am not sure which is more dangerous to
      swim with, the nurse shark who really is very gentle of the pigs who
      really are looking for free food and you just might get in their way of
      it.&nbsp; The Thunder ball Grotto, a cave, is a hollowed-out island where
      James Bond movies &quot;Thunderball&quot; and &quot;Never Say Never
      Again&quot; as well as &quot;Splash&quot; were filmed was not all that
      scary.<br />
      <br />
      We have been slowly making our way south through the many Exumas islands,
      which consists of over 360 cays (islands).&nbsp; You can not walk on all
      of them, the approach is too tough, you can not find way to climb on to
      them, or they are private.&nbsp; Several rich folks have been able to buy
      the entire island so they are some what off limits for us cruisers.&nbsp;
      That&#39;s ok because there are more than enough public islands for us to
      anchor by and play on.&nbsp; The Exumas also have a National Park on
      several of the islands so fishing and taking conchs are off limits.&nbsp;
      We had our first conch salad and fritters the other day, a bit flavorless
      but you could not beat the adventure of hunting, cleaning, and then the
      other

      boat prepared them.&nbsp; Ok so the hunting just involves snorkeling
      around looking for ones that have a curled lip, that means they are big
      enough to keep.<br />
      <br />
      Dean tried making white bread the other day.&nbsp; No matter how many
      loaves you buy in the US you are bound to run out some time.&nbsp; Making
      bread really is not that hard but if the yeast gets too warm in this nice
      sunshine, they really don&#39;t rise up all that well.<br />
      <br />
      While in the Exuma park we snorkeled on some nice caves, one with
      stalagmites and stalactites.&nbsp; We were able to snorkel in one, and
      climb out onto &quot;dry&quot; land inside which was cool.&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      We also went and put our boat name marker on BooBoo Hill which is known by
      cruisers.&nbsp; If you pass by, you make a marker out of driftwood and
      leave it on the hill.<br />
      <br />
      On the same hill, were some blow holes, which sent up quite a gust of air,
      Kris and Derek were able to cool off quite a bit by standing by the
      holes.<br />
      <br />
      As to the pigs, none of us swam with them.&nbsp; They are quite large and
      aggressive if they think there is food for them - which they always
      think.&nbsp; They must be upwards of 600 lbs, and have large cloven
      hooves, which could do some real damage if they decided you had
      food.&nbsp; They swim fast as well - can you tell that I am suggesting
      that swimming with pigs is a bad idea - which we discovered once we saw
      them and experienced them swimming to the dink and begging for food.&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      Thunderball cave is really cool.&nbsp; We took some food and fed the fish
      some stale cheese crackers.&nbsp; Derek held the cracker in his had and it
      was like a feeding frenzy of about 100 yellow and black damselfish.&nbsp;
      We couldn&#39;t get the fish to leave us alone after that, they followed
      us all through the cave.&nbsp; We really need to get a waterproof
      camera!<br />

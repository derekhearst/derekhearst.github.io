				We had a nice Christmas.&nbsp; We all got together over on the 
				boat Day Dreamer.&nbsp; Yes, all 20 of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Us, 
				Pollux, Elin, Emily Grace, and Day Dreamer got together for 
				Christmas Eve.&nbsp; The kids did Secret Santa gift exchange, 
				and everyone was very happy with their treasures.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The next morning, we had the normal gift ripping party on &quot;What 
				If&quot;, and we all got some surprises and nice treats for 
				Christmas.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Later Christmas day, we moved from the Pigeon Point anchorage in 
				Guadeloupe, back up to the Deshaies anchorage because Pigeon 
				Point was rolly again.&nbsp; The rest of Christmas was relaxing 
				and eating - like any other normal Christmas.<br />
				<br />
				The day after Christmas (Boxing day), we left and had a pleasant 
				48 mile sail up to Antigua.&nbsp; We even spotted a couple of 
				whales.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				The next morning we checked in, and spent a week at the Falmouth 
				Harbor anchorage in Antigua.&nbsp; It was nice and calm in 
				there, and our friends on Pollux joined us, as well as Emily 
				Grace.&nbsp; The next day, we saw Day Dreamer, Elin and Spirit 
				of Argo pull in as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Pollux bought a one week membership at the local yacht club, and 
				that entitled them to use of the small sailboats the yacht club 
				has as well.&nbsp; The boys off Pollux were kind enough to 
				share, and Derek had a good time sailing around the anchorage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<br />
				<br />
				Kris got to play Mexican train dominoes on the beach one last 
				time with the gang, which was fun, even though she lost yet 
				again.<br />
				<br />
				The weather was looking good for a trip.&nbsp; The wind had been 
				over 25 knots for over a week, and finally we were getting a 
				break, and we decided it was time to move while the weather was 
				good.&nbsp; We left Falmouth harbor, and moved around to Jolly 
				Harbor to get groceries and check out.&nbsp; Then headed out at 
				3:00 a.m. to make the 80 nautical mile run to St. Barts.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				We did OK, and passed Gustavia Harbor in St. Barts with our 
				mouths hanging open at all the Mega Yachts.&nbsp; We kept going 
				and took a mooring at a small island to the west of St. Bart&#39;s 
				called Ile Fourche.<br />
				<br />
				The next morning we hiked around on the island, which is 
				uninhabited, and had lots of trails and great rocks to climb.&nbsp; 
				However the weather was picking up again, and a decidedly 
				unpleasant roll was occurring in the anchorage, so around noon, 
				we hoisted anchor and headed for St. Martin where we began to 
				tackle the &quot;Big Boat Project&quot;</div>

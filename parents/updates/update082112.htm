      We came to Mystic Seaport in Connecticut for Derek&#39;s sailing lessons
      and have spent a great two weeks learning all about the Seaport and
      watching Derek sail out in the bay.<br />
      <br />
      After watching some kids doing sailing lessons in Stamford while anchored
      there, Derek decided he wanted to take sailing lessons.&nbsp; We settled
      on Mystic Seaport, CT because they offered lessons, and there was a place
      to anchor nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus Mystic Seaport is just
      cool.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Mystic Seaport, founded in 1929, is a outdoor museum which is a re-created
      coastal village.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; historic tall ships at anchor and a
      working historical shipyard. It has&nbsp; living history shops and 19th
      century craftsmen, ranging from coppersmiths and printers to sail makers
      and riggers. The village&#39;s historic buildings were moved here from
      other New England locations. There are also maritime galleries and
      exhibitions as well as a planetarium, which has programs about celestial
      navigation.
      <br />
      <br />
      The place we have anchored in for the two weeks has been in 4 to 5 feet of
      water, (ok sometimes the water is less than 4 feet and since our boat
      needs 4 feet of water sometimes we are sitting in the mud).&nbsp; It has
      been a very calm anchorage and even with the couple of wind and lightning
      storms overall it has seemed like we have been on dry land.&nbsp; The
      dingy dock is very close so walking the dogs has been very easy but the
      best part has been watching the sailing lessons out our front door
      step.&nbsp; There are morning and afternoon classes so lots of sails
      moving round and when Derek was in his class the binoculars were close at
      hand.&nbsp; Derek was able to sail a J 15 with one other student and now
      knows all the points of sail and is able to make his boat go where he
      wants it to.&nbsp; The last couple of days they even had some races and he
      took 1st the first few times and then 2nd the second day.&nbsp; He had a
      really good time, and we enjoyed the two weeks of hanging out and
      watching.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Kris spent a bit of time touring the Seaport and going through all of the
      displays and buildings.<br />
      <br />
      It is almost the end of August and while we have been here we have reduced
      our project list down to a hand full, I think the full list was around 150
      items.&nbsp; We are planning on starting the journey south but will be
      stopping along the Connecticut anchorages to meet up with friends.&nbsp;
      Our next major event will be hauling the boat in Virginia to apply fresh
      bottom paint, how exciting.&nbsp; This will be about a week with the boat
      out of the water and us living in it, not that fun but only a week.&nbsp;
      After that it will be continuing south.

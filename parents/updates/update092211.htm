      We motored up the Potomac River to Washington DC, tried to sail but the
      winds and the winding river just did not make for good sailing.&nbsp; The
      logs in the river also were tough to avoid as you sailed so motoring made
      the most sense.&nbsp; We passed by Mount Vernon, home to George
      Washington, you can see the dogs were really interested.&nbsp; Derek did
      homework, the smile was not always on his face as his teachers are pushing
      him to do more.&nbsp; In one of the anchorages Derek decided that taming
      ducks might be a good job for him in the future so he was trying his hand
      at it.<br />
      <br />
      The weather has been so so and this morning we woke up to fog.&nbsp; We
      waited until 10:30 before it was clear enough for us to motor on.&nbsp;
      The only folks that were moving around in it were some bass fisherman, I
      think there was going to be a tournament in the area so they were out
      checking the area for good fishing spots, Monty C knows what I am talking
      about.<br />
      <br />
      We are now anchored just off the Potomac river in Washington DC.&nbsp; We
      pay $15 per day for dinghy dock access, showers, laundry and
      internet.&nbsp; Also available is a library and computer with
      printer.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      There are so many sites to visit here that we will be taking the next week
      walking the town and seeing the many sites.&nbsp; We were told the
      International Spy Museum was something worth while to see and some one had
      told me that I needed to visit &quot;Fords Theater&quot; the site where
      Abraham Lincoln had been assassinated.&nbsp;
      <br />
      &nbsp;<br />
      We went to the Smithsonian Air and Space museum today.&nbsp; We were there
      from 10:00 to 3:00 and had a good time.&nbsp; We also walked through the
      scuplture gardens which were really neat, and the Hirshhom museum of art.
      Got a bit of a scare at the art museum when Derek stepped to close to a
      piece of art and alarms went off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomorrow is the Spy Museum
      and then Saturday and Sunday we will spend walking the mall and looking at
      Monuments.&nbsp; (at least that is the plan)<br />

				Cruisers tend to be very helpful with other cruisers.&nbsp; If 
				someone is needing an egg for dinner you might loan yours and 
				get it replaced next week when the shopping bus came by.&nbsp; 
				Movies, music and ebooks are passed around as well.&nbsp; The 
				boat Moana Roa is from Australia and wanted to make sure we had 
				seen some of the films that come from that great country.&nbsp; 
				Of course you have the well known Crocodile Dundee series and 
				the Mad Max series but they also introduced us to &quot;The Castle&quot; 
				and &quot;Kenny&quot; both of which are comedies.&nbsp; I will not spoil 
				the movies but if you are looking for some entertainment do not 
				miss out on these two films.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#39;t give up on 
				them in the first 30 minutes, you have to watch them to the end 
				to appreciate the humor.<br />
				<br />
				Halloween was celebrated here at Grenada/Hog Island by many of 
				the boat kids.&nbsp; While the holiday is not one that island 
				recognizes it is one that the kids on the boats would let go by 
				with out celebrating.&nbsp; Finding candy to pass out is not 
				like in the states where the grocery stores have isles of 
				chocolate and other candies.&nbsp; Here it took a bit of work to 
				track down enough to fill the bags of the trick or treaters.&nbsp; 
				There were only a dozen or so who went by dinghy from&nbsp; boat 
				to boat and braved the little rain that was falling.&nbsp; In 
				the end everyone left with enough candy to keep them happy for a 
				few weeks.<br />
				<br />
				We do a lot of walking even though we are on a sailboat.&nbsp; 
				When we moved onto the boat we still wore shoes from time to 
				time but as we headed into warmer areas the shoes were traded 
				for sandals/TEVAs/flip flops.&nbsp; Over the last few months we 
				have started to wear through them, well Derek is just growing 
				out of them.&nbsp; The pair on the right have been fixed once 
				with 3M 5200 but they are ready for the trash now.&nbsp; It is 
				not like you can&#39;t find replacement shoes but these have seen&nbsp; 
				a lot of miles.<br />
				<br />
				It has been the rainy season in Grenada, this year has been one 
				of the driest on record.&nbsp; Many boats have water collection 
				systems so when it does rain they collect the fresh water and 
				put it into their water tanks on the boat.&nbsp; We have not 
				worried too much water since we have a water maker and it has 
				kept up with our needs and the solar has been able to provide 
				the power needed.&nbsp; Since we did have some time and spare 
				parts we are attempting to collect water as well.&nbsp; We have 
				two different systems that collect rain water off the dodger top 
				that we are trying.&nbsp; Now when it rains Dean goes out into 
				the cockpit and watches the rain water trickle into our tanks, 
				who needs tv.<br />
				<br />
				It is the time of year when people head out.&nbsp; Hurricane 
				season is over, so one of the main topics of discussion is 
				&quot;where you headed - and when&quot;.&nbsp; We have several kid boats 
				here, and we are all trying to coordinate still spending as much 
				time together as possible.&nbsp; We will start heading north in 
				mid November, and plan on next summer back in the states.&nbsp; 
				Then it is time to sell the boat and look for work - unless - 
				plans sometimes change on a dime, so who knows???.<br />

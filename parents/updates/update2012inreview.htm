      It is the holiday time and the end of the 2012 year.&nbsp; Last year we
      celebrated Christmas in Florida and this year in the Bahamas.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      We are fortunate enough to be around friends.&nbsp; We are in Staniel Cay,
      Bahamas, along with our friends on &quot;Full Monty&quot;, which is a
      family of 4 on a catamaran, with a 10 year old boy and a 12 year old
      girl.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Good Trade&quot; is also here, which is another
      catamaran with a 12 year old boy.&nbsp; In addition there is
      &quot;Essentiel&quot;, a French boat with 12 year old twin boys aboard,
      who speak fair English.&nbsp; There are two other boats, one with a 5 year
      old boy, and one with a 8 year old boy, both French boats.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Christmas Eve day the local yacht club hosted a party for all kids, with
      crafts, games, food, a visit from Santa, and then all the kids got
      stockings with goodies, and a wrapped present as well.&nbsp; Derek was
      well fed on pizza, cupcakes, and ice cream, and his stocking held candy, a
      game and a slinky.&nbsp; His present was a basketball, which may not be
      the best for a boat, but the Yacht Club did a great job and was very
      generous for all the visiting kids.<br />
      Christmas Eve we had a bonfire on the beach with all the aforementioned
      boats, along with a couple of others who joined in.<br />
      <br />
      On Christmas, day, we had a leisurely morning eating homemade cinnamon
      buns, and opened presents.&nbsp; Then Derek went snorkeling with
      &quot;Full Monty&quot; to the Thunderball caves, and also snorkeled with
      some local rays and nurse sharks.&nbsp; That was all followed by swimming
      and playing off the boat.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      For dinner we went over to &quot;Good Trade&quot; and had a great time
      visiting with them.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      It was a full and busy Christmas Day<br />
      We wish all of you a Merry Christmas.<br />
      <br />
      We will be heading south slowly, and eventually make a jump to Puerto Rico
      and spend some time there.

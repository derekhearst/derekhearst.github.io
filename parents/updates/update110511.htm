      Arriving at Charleston was in warm and sunny weather, we took a dock at
      the Maritime Center Marina and spent the following 7 days tied up to the
      dock.&nbsp; Charleston has a great looking bridge that is visible from
      most everywhere and on the trip so far we have seen a variety of different
      types. Being at the dock allowed for fresh water all the time and being
      hooked to power full time was great, the weather was not :(.&nbsp; Not
      sure where the cold weather came from but getting up to 50 degrees in the
      morning just is not fun.<br />
      <br />
      Glenn and Linda McConnell came down from Charlotte NC to visit us, they
      are long time friends of Dean&#39;s family, see their visit on the visitor
      page.&nbsp; We also had the previous owners of the boat, Jim and&nbsp;
      Dorrell Antley,&nbsp; come back to give us tips and suggestions.&nbsp; Jim
      and Dorrell had cruised on the boat for many years and have lots of good
      memories and suggestions for the current owners.&nbsp; Bill Hall of
      American Classic Tea Plantation came by as well, Bill has owned boats in
      the past and has an eye for a large catamaran. (Ours is quite small to
      Bill)<br />
      <br />
      We were in Charleston for Halloween and&nbsp; built a scary Halloween
      costume for Derek.&nbsp; Derek had been dreaming of a &quot;headless&quot;
      costume and so between Derek and Kris they were able to make one that
      received comments all night long.&nbsp; Bob and Anne B were able to make
      an overnight sail to make it to Charleston to also join us on the rounds
      of candy gathering.<br />
      <br />
      The marina has a washing machine and dryer so some laundry could be
      done.&nbsp; It usually had a line of people wanting to use it so Kris
      tried to make sure she was first in line at 8 a.m.&nbsp; There were some
      people who did not follow &quot;proper&quot; usage and they caused a bit
      of problems with the others.&nbsp; Sam had been having some issues with
      his food and that caused a bit more laundry than anticipated.&nbsp; <br />
      <br />
      Shops and more shops, at least that what it seems as you walk around
      Charleston.&nbsp; There seems like there are more stores and more things
      to buy then you might have time for.&nbsp; Kris and Derek went shopping or
      at least browsing for good deals one afternoon and even had the fun of
      tasting different honeys.&nbsp; The local grocery store, Harris Teeter,
      was within 1/2 mile so provisioning was just a short walk. <br />

      Friday we&nbsp; were taken out to dinner by Ed and Juliana Hill at their
      yacht club.&nbsp; During the evening we thought we recognized
      <span class="st">John Ratzenberger</span>, from the Cheers show.&nbsp; I
      guess John R&#39;s brother belongs to the yacht club and will show up from
      time to time.&nbsp; Well after ice cream the yacht club&#39;s launch took
      us back to our boat but had to stop and pick up another group, the
      <span class="st"> Ratzenberger </span>party.&nbsp; As the launch came to
      our boat John R noticed the name and asked if we had ever saw a movie
      called &quot;What If&quot;, John R was an actor in the movie.&nbsp; A
      guard at Louisville, Richard, happened to give us the movie so we had
      already watched it and responded that he had been in the movie.&nbsp; He
      offered to sign the boat but we left prior to that happening :(.&nbsp;
      <br />
      <br />
      Saturday 8/14 we took a group out for a sail around Bridgeport.&nbsp; The
      boat was ready, people showed up and we motored out into the harbor, too
      bad the wind did not participate.&nbsp; We bobbed around for a few hours,
      had lunch, toured the Bridgeport harbor and then motored back to
      Captain&#39;s Cove.&nbsp; A very enjoyable day due to the people and nice
      weather but a bit more wind would have been nice.<br />
      <br />
      Sunday we were leaving until the rains dumped and dumped, we decided that
      staying put was the best option (at least it was the driest).&nbsp; So we
      sat and relaxed for the first time on our trip.&nbsp; It rained all day
      and other than walking the dogs we stayed inside and read, played games,
      too a well deserved nap :).<br />
      <br />
      Derek had two friends, Chaz and Dylan Stolba, come to the boat for the
      next 3 nights.&nbsp; We rose early on Monday and started motoring in the
      early rain, again this rain stuff.&nbsp; The wind did pick up some and and
      motored/sailed all day down to Port Washington, picked up a free town
      mooring and went swimming.&nbsp; Dylan did kind of fall overboard on the
      way - read about that on the &quot;Visitors&quot; page.<br />
      <br />
      The next day we motored from Manhasset bay through the East River past the
      Statue of Liberty and into Great Kills Bay in Staten Island, NY.&nbsp; The
      sun finally came out.&nbsp; Dean and the boys went swimming and to play on
      the beach, while Kris worked on the engine (yet again).&nbsp; Check out
      our &quot;Visitors&quot; page to read more about Chaz and Dylans visit.<br />
      <br />
      The engine had a small oil leak and small fuel leak, but both now fixed,
      and only took about 1 1/2 hours to do.&nbsp; We also discovered that the
      bows which are partially foam filled, were also water filled, and we
      started the process of getting the water out. <br />
      Kris had been complaining about the bows being too heavy for a while, and
      tried to convince Dean that there was water in there, but Dean was not
      going for it.&nbsp; Nagging finally paid off and a hole was drilled and
      voila - water.&nbsp; Not to say Kris is gloating, but that would be the
      appropriate word. <br />
      <br />
      Chaz and Dylan were picked up by their folks the evening of the 17th, and
      Mark and Laurie Stolba were kind enough to pick up some packages for us,
      and made a trip to Home Depot for supplies for us, and most importantly -
      were kind enough to stop at McDonalds on their way and get dinner for the
      What If crew, who some of them were having greasy french fry
      withdrawls.<br />
      Saying goodbye to friends is always hard, but we look forward to seeing
      everyone again next year.

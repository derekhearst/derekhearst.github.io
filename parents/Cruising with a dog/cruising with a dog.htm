            Take your pet to a vet and get a titer test done for rabies.&nbsp;
            You must first vaccinate your pet against rabies, and then after one
            month or more take your pet in for a titer test.&nbsp; This blood
            work then goes off to Kansas State for the titer test to be done,
            and it can take a while (one to 3 months) for the results to come
            back.&nbsp; You will want the results mailed to your vet, and you
            will need the hard copy of the results to take with you once you
            leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; This paperwork is the FAVN report.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            You will also need a microchip for your dog, one accepted
            internationally, and a rabies certificate, which you will get with
            the shot.&nbsp; You will also need a &quot;United States Interstate
            and International Certificate of Health Examination
            form&quot;.&nbsp; Most vets should know this form and be able to
            fill it out.&nbsp; - Call around and make sure your find a vet that
            knows the form.&nbsp; There is a spot on the forms for a USDA Vet to
            stamp the form.&nbsp; We did not have this done - because we did not
            realize it.&nbsp; If it is not too difficult to get this stamp, you
            should.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please get your pet inoculated against all
            common diseases, and make sure you have a stock of medicine for
            Heartworm and fleas and ticks.&nbsp; We found Triflexis to be a good
            med for our dogs.&nbsp; We used a tick collar until we got to St.
            Martin, and then we used Certifect in combination with it for
            ticks.&nbsp; It would also be a good idea to get some I.D. tags for
            your dog, with your boat name on it.&nbsp;

            The Bahamas does a good job, except for on speed.&nbsp;&nbsp; You
            need an import permit in advance to take a pet to the Bahamas.&nbsp;
            Apply for one very early, as it will be mailed or faxed to you for
            an additional charge.&nbsp; I am talking like 4 months early.&nbsp;
            Get a international money order from a post office, and send the
            money order and the import form to the Bahamas.&nbsp; They will send
            back the permit.&nbsp; Take the permit to a vet, with your pet and
            get an international health certificate for the pet.&nbsp; Have the
            vet write in as much information on vaccines and treatments as you
            can.&nbsp; MAKE SURE THEY STAMP IT IN THE USDA VET AREA, OR SIGN
            IT.&nbsp; Call and check around to find a vet who is familiar with
            the forms and has the authority to stamp it.&nbsp; The BVI&#39;s
            will check for this, as will Antigua.<br />
            In all honesty, I don&#39;t know how the Bahamas would ever know if
            you had an import permit or not.&nbsp; We were never asked, never
            checked.&nbsp; There are many, many stray dogs all over the Bahamas,
            so always have your pet leashed.&nbsp; Be aware that dogs as pets,
            that are not used for guarding is not common in the Bahamas, so
            expect some people to be afraid of your dog, if it is larger,
            especially kids and be courteous to this.

            I can only speak to checking in and out of the Dominican Republic
            while we were a guest of the Marina Puerto Bahia in Samana.&nbsp; I
            was a- little concerned after reading noonsite, but reality was much
            different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Customs and Immigration and the Navy all came
            on the boat, after making sure our dog would not attack them - they
            were all very leery of him.&nbsp; They petted him and that was
            it.&nbsp; Did not ask for any paperwork or
            anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would think that this is pretty
            common, and would not hesitate to take a pet to Luperon or Ocean
            World or Samana.&nbsp; I would not do the south coast of the
            Dominican Republic for different reasons.

            We checked in to Puerto Rico in Mayaguez by phone and then in
            person.&nbsp; On the phone they asked if we had a pet, and we said
            yes.&nbsp; They asked if we had all the proper paperwork - again we
            said yes.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp; Later in person nothing was
            asked.&nbsp; We were concerned, as per noonsite, the health
            certificate had to be less than two weeks old, but there was not a
            vet available for the past two weeks before arriving in Puerto
            Rico.&nbsp; We have found that most pets arriving on cruising boats
            are treated much differently than pets arriving by air.

            You must send your import paperwork into the BVI&#39;s in
            advance.&nbsp;&nbsp; We used a email/fax service and would email and
            fax the paperwork in.&nbsp; You MUST have your FAVN report to bring
            a pet into the BVI&#39;s.&nbsp; They will check for this and the
            Health Certificate and will make sure that the Health Certificate is
            no older than two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although we sent our paperwork
            4 days ahead of time, they remembered seeing it, but did not have it
            with them, and they had never sent anything back to us saying we
            were approved, so we had to fill it out again while the vet
            waited.&nbsp;&nbsp; We checked in at West End Tortolla, and found
            the vet very nice.&nbsp; We did not have a health certificate that
            was less than two weeks old, and he let us in
            anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost for dog was $10.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Before leaving the BVI and heading to St. Martin, we got a new
            health certificate from the vet - it cost $10, and took 5
            minutes.&nbsp; We thought we would need this for St. Martin.<br />
            <br />
            On the way north it was a totally different story.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since
            we had faxed the paperwork in ahead of time before and never had a
            response and we ended up having to fill it in again, we did not send
            anything in ahead of time, but just took the filled in paperwork
            with us.&nbsp; We arrived at Gun Creek in Virgin Gorda and were
            given the phone number of the vet to call for inspection.&nbsp; We
            arranged the inspection for the next morning.&nbsp; In this
            inspection everything was fine, except we were charged $50 for a
            penalty for not having pre-approval to come to the BVI&#39;s by
            faxing the paperwork in ahead of time.&nbsp; This time the vet did
            not care about the FAVN or health certificate, but only wanted to
            see the rabies vaccination.<br />
            <br />
            I would advise having all the paperwork and&nbsp; faxing or emailing
            the application in.&nbsp; Clearly there is no consistency in the
            BVI&#39;s so be prepared for anything. Don&#39;t expect to hear
            back, after you send stuff in, but maybe you will get lucky and hear
            something.&nbsp; Either way, you will pay $10 for check in or $60
            for check in and penalty.

            Customs and Immigration will call the vet, he will come to the
            office to check your paperwork and animal.&nbsp; It is easiest on
            the vet if you bring your vessel to the dock right by Customs and
            Immigration and tie up there.&nbsp; We did this and it was great
            because after clearing in, we walked through the small shopping
            area, before leaving the dock.&nbsp; The vet will look for your FAVN
            titer results, when your rabies vaccinations were, he will scan the
            animal to verify the correct microchip identification matches the
            paperwork, and will look to make sure the pet as been treated for
            external and internal parasites.&nbsp; Contrary to the information
            online, he did not say anything about import paperwork, and he did
            not care about the health certificate from St. Maarten, or the
            BVI&#39;s, he just wanted to see the one from the United States,
            which was out of date, but he didn&#39;t seem to care.&nbsp; There
            was a $50 fee for checking in our dog.

          <td style="width: 629px" class="style2">
            Before coming into Dominica I was worried, as per their
            requirements.&nbsp; I emailed the agriculture dept, using the email
            posted here, and in the response I was told that I would have to
            have a health certificate from my last port.&nbsp; Since the last
            port was Les Saintes, and I don&#39;t speak French and could not
            find a vet I was worried.&nbsp;&nbsp; I explained this via email and
            Dr. Thomas who answered my email was very cooperative and said that
            they would work with me on this and to send what paperwork I
            had.&nbsp; I emailed in all I had, and had a permit emailed back to
            me within 3 days.&nbsp; Excellent service and very
            cooperative.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the permit it said that the animal would
            be accompanied by a health certificate stating that the animal had
            completed a quarantine, which of course it had not. (see sample
            permit via link on right).&nbsp; When we arrived in Dominica, there
            was a spot on the customs form for a pet, which we checked, but they
            did not say anything.&nbsp; When we went to walk Sam, we were
            stopped on the dock by an official and were asked for our
            paperwork.&nbsp;&nbsp; We showed them the import permit and they
            were not sure, so they called the boss and asked them and were told
            that the stamped permit was all that was needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            We were also stopped by a local resident who warned us about dogs
            needing paperwork, or they would be taken.&nbsp; We were told by the
            PAYS representative who came to our boat as well.
            <br />
            A park ranger also asked to see the dogs
            paperwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, people we met on
            another boat, had no paperwork, but were stopped.&nbsp; A vet was
            called and an inspection done of the pet - I don&#39;t know if they
            had any support paperwork on rabies and FAVN test, but they paid $50
            U.S. and were allowed in.&nbsp; I would recommend getting the permit
            in advance, as it is free and quite easy.<br />
            <br />
            On the way north we applied ahead of time for the
            permit.&nbsp;&nbsp; We used the health certificate we got before we
            left Grenada.&nbsp;&nbsp; They wanted us to get one from the last
            port visited, and we explained we did not speak French and the last
            port was Martinique.&nbsp;&nbsp; The import permit was given to us
            anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we arrived we declared the dog on the
            Customs and Immigration form, and no questions asked, however when
            we took our dog ashore at the government dock by Customs and
            Immigration we were stopped and told we need a vet inspection, and
            were not allowed to bring the dog ashore.&nbsp; Another cruiser had
            a similar experience while walking the dog in town they were
            accosted and harassed by a person identifying themselves as a vet
            technician, who berated them, and then issued them the vet
            inspection permit, without actually doing any examination or even
            looking at the pet.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did have a valid import permit
            as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have contacted the Agriculture
            department regards the experiences and they were once again very
            concerned and were going to look into the issue.&nbsp; My advice -
            get the import permit, and when you check in, get customs or
            immigration to call and get a vet to come inspect your pet.&nbsp; If
            your are told it is not required, then get the name of the person
            who told you that, and keep their name, and your import permit with
            you at all times when you take your dog ashore.

            We sent in the paperwork to St. Lucia early and a stamped import
            form was sent back, so we did not bother to get a health certificate
            from Martinique.&nbsp; Upon arrival in St. Lucia, Customs asked if
            we had seen the vet.&nbsp; We said that we had a stamped import
            permit for St. Lucia.&nbsp; They said, didn&#39;t matter, had to see
            the vet and called the vet.&nbsp; We were told to wait at the dinghy
            dock for the vet with our dog, and the vet would arrive at
            2:30.&nbsp; It was hot, so instead of waiting in the dinghy at the
            dock, we waited under the shade of a tree 20&#39; from the head of
            the dinghy dock.&nbsp; Customs came by and made sure we did not take
            the dog any further, and let us know that the dog really should not
            be out of the dinghy.&nbsp; At 3:45 the vet arrived at the dinghy
            dock, and also let us know that the dog should not be out of the
            dinghy, but understood about shade.&nbsp; She wanted the health
            certificate from Martinique.&nbsp; We explained we did not have
            one.&nbsp; She checked all the other paperwork, and said we were OK,
            because we had the rabies vaccination paperwork, but should have had
            the health certificate from Martinique.&nbsp;&nbsp; The requirements
            for import to St. Lucia states the dog must be given treatment for
            parasites 72 hours before arriving in St. Lucia.&nbsp; We did not do
            that, since we did not go to a vet in Martinique, but the vet in St.
            Lucia did not even comment on that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Checking in our dog
            cost $45 EC, and the vet did not have change, so make sure you have
            the exact amount.<br />
            <br />
            On the way north, we did not bother to apply for the permit ahead of
            time.&nbsp; We should have.&nbsp; When we got there, the vet would
            not come unless we had the permit.&nbsp; We emailed in the stuff,
            and the permit was issued same day, then we arranged to meet the vet
            at 9:00 a.m. in the morning.&nbsp; This time the vet was 45 minutes
            late.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were inspected, the original of the permit
            given to us and a reciept.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were asked twice
            while walking around the marina area for the dogs paperwork by a
            customs/immigration representative.&nbsp;&nbsp; We took the dog to
            the dock area by the grocery stores, and walked him there and were
            never asked for paperwork.

            arriving, and to notify the Government Veterinary Official 48 hours
            before arriving.&nbsp; We did neither based on other cruisers
            experience.&nbsp; We checked in at Carriacou, and checked the form
            that we had a dog.&nbsp; Customs and Immigration did not care, and
            did not say anything.&nbsp; We have taken the dog ashore several

            the blood draw to send to Kansas State for the dog rabies titer
            test.&nbsp; They said it takes two months, so if you spend hurricane
            season near Grenada, and plan on going back north through the
            Caribbean, this is a good place to get your FAVN, titer test done.

      Sheppard&nbsp; ?<br />

      Oso and Sam were all over the Bahamas.&nbsp; Oso died from old age, and
      only Sam travelled with us through the rest of the Caribbean.&nbsp; We did

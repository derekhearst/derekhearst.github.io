				Arriving into Charleston allowed us to catch up on some of the 
				projects we have been putting off.&nbsp; Doing laundry on all 
				those odds and ends not just the required clothes and towels, 
				Kris ended up doing 14 loads.&nbsp; We were at a marina that had 
				free washing machines, two of them and they were kept busy.&nbsp; 
				The boat received a good scrubbing with soap and fresh water, 
				salt water is ok but having unlimited fresh allowed everything 
				to get scrubbed down.&nbsp; Going through all the boat lockers 
				looking for water, mold or getting rid of those things you 
				thought we could not do with out but we did.<br />
				<br />
				We also have a list -- imagine that -- of some 120 items that we 
				want to fix/improve/repair prior to leaving again.&nbsp; Some 
				items are simple &quot;buy a new cutting board that fits into the 
				cutting board area&quot;; while others are more complicated &quot;fix the 
				boom vang, because it broke&quot;.&nbsp; So with the ability of the 
				internet for research and finding the best prices we are making 
				a list and ordering for items to be shipped to a staging area.&nbsp; 
				We looked at who we might rope into this task and picked/asked 
				John M for his address and space.<br />
				<br />
				There are a lot of smaller items we will pick up along the way north and some projects like sewing 
				projects are&nbsp; what we will do as we 
				have &quot;open&quot; time.&nbsp; Derek has completed&nbsp; 6th grade, 
				except for a research paper that we are making him do, that was 
				not part of the normal curriculum,&nbsp; and then he will have a few weeks off.&nbsp; 
				We plan on starting up 7th grade this summer and getting a good 
				start prior to the normal school year.<br />
				<br />
				We were waiting in Charleston for our friends Bob and Anne on 
				Baloo who were coming up from the Bahamas, they arrived with out 
				any issues.&nbsp; Anne needed to make a trip to Washington for 
				family reasons and their friend and ours&nbsp; Dale J. flew out 
				to help Bob move the boat up north.&nbsp; We had meet Dale and 
				his family when we were cruising in 1994 so we wanted to catch 
				up on old and new stories.<br />
				<br />
				While we were waiting in Charleston we met another kid boat, 
				&quot;Day Dreamer&quot; who has 3 girls Emma, Anna and Sarah.&nbsp; Derek 
				got along with them great and we spent many hours with them 
				while in Charleston.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many Live Oak 
				trees&nbsp; in Charleston and they made great climbing trees for 
				the kids, but their favorite was a large magnolia tree in the 
				park.&nbsp; Day Dreamer is planning on spending the summer up 
				north in Maine so we probably will see them again.<br />
				<br />
				From Charleston we did an overnight trip up to Beaufort, N.C.,&nbsp; 
				and then took the ICW up to Norfolk.&nbsp; Along the way we 
				stopped at our old haunt, the Alligator River Marina.&nbsp; The 
				marina is along the highway and probably services more cars than 
				boats but it has a small grill and the best hamburgers around.&nbsp; 
				We treated Bob and Dale to a fine dinner and even had alligator 
				bites for hours devours (this is breaded alligator meat bites).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				&quot;What If&quot;&nbsp; has stopped there on every trip and probably 
				will continue in the future.&nbsp; As we motored away the next 
				day it appeared as though we had an extra passenger.&nbsp; 
				Looking on Baloo&#39;s head sail we spotted a coiled snake who was 
				hanging on for the free ride.&nbsp; Bob managed to get the 6 
				foot snake off the boat with out incident.&nbsp; Not sure how 
				the snake got there but both boats did a thoroughly snake check 
				to make sure we did not have any additional passengers.<br />
				<br />
				We finally arrived in Norfolk on June 25th and dropped the 
				anchor at Hospital Point.&nbsp; Shortly after the hook was down 
				we experienced the highest winds and hardest down pour we have 
				ever seen.&nbsp; Dale who was on Baloo and who has single 
				handled a sailboat from Australia and down to Easter Island said 
				it was the worst one he has seen as well.&nbsp; The highest wind 
				recorded during the storm was 66 knots. We had rain and even 
				some hail, and lots of lightning.&nbsp; Visibility dropped to 
				about 300 feet during the storm.&nbsp; We weathered the storm 
				O.K.,&nbsp; but Baloo was close to a lightning strike and lost 
				their refrigerator and several instruments like the depth 
				sounder; so now Bob is in the process of repairing the boat 
				prior to being able to leave the area.<br />
				<br />
				The history around Norfolk is amazing, it seems like the area 
				has been involved in just about every war, either the fighting 
				occurred in the area or they have built ships to support the war 
				effort.&nbsp; As you leave the area by water you go down 
				&quot;Battleship Row&quot;, dock after dock of Navy ships being worked on 
				and then as you are sailing out of the harbor you usually have 
				to dodge either a Navy war ship or one of the many commercial 
				ships.&nbsp; We did catch a picture of the new Navy &quot;stealth&quot; 
				boat, if was very quite and went fast through the water and the 
				paint job was sure different.</div>

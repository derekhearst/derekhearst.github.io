				We haven&#39;t posted in a while, and that&#39;s because there is not 
				anything special going on.&nbsp; We are still here in Grenada, 
				just hanging out and waiting for hurricane season to end.&nbsp; 
				Luckily, no hurricanes yet, just lazy days of summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<br />
				<br />
				Every morning Dean takes Sam for a walk, before the sun gets up 
				too high and it gets too warm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris and Derek do 
				school, until lunch, and then after lunch Derek goes off to play 
				with some of the other 13 kids in the anchorage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				We have started taking Sam swimming in the afternoons, we put on 
				his life jacket, and he does a couple of laps around the boat.&nbsp; 
				He seems to really enjoy it.<br />
				<br />
				The kids stay busy kayaking, swimming, sailing and playing on 
				the beach.<br />
				When Derek is off then Kris and Dean have relax time and usually 
				try to work on a small boat project, read, relax and do basic 
				chores on the boat.<br />
				<br />
				We have been going into the local bar to watch the America&#39;s Cup 
				Races on the television, and have enjoyed that.&nbsp; Once a 
				week Kris heads to town to get groceries.&nbsp; Usually once a 
				week there is some kind of social gathering between the other 
				cruisers that we participate in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most afternoons 
				some cruisers gather at the tables on the beach to play Mexican 
				Train Dominoes, or Farkle, and we join in on occasion.<br />
				<br />
				We have been to several birthday parties, dinners on other 
				boats, group activities touring inland, and just informal get 
				togethers.<br />
				<br />
				It is actually surprising how busy we all stay.<br />
				<br />
				We are currently at a small island just north of the main island 
				of Grenada, for a change of pace and in a couple of weeks we 
				will head to Trinidad, to do some sightseeing and for a change 
				of pace.<br />
				<br />
				Other than that, 
				for the first time in a long time we have absolutely no plans 
				other than day to day.&nbsp; No obligations, no schedules per 
				say, no other people depending on us.&nbsp; It is really quite 
				refreshing.<br />

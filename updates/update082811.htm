				The storm has passed during the night and morning and we are 
				still floating and have no issues <span class="style1"><strong>
				:)</strong></span>.&nbsp; We had rain from yesterday at 10 am 
				and then the winds started to pick up around 10 pm.&nbsp; Either 
				Kris or Dean watched during the night and saw gusts up to 45 
				knots, this location sure protected the boat from the winds.&nbsp; 
				That is one advantage of having the boat, we could move to safer 
				locations as the storm started moving up the US coast.&nbsp; In 
				the news around here the winds were up to 65 knots.&nbsp; Talked to a local gentleman this morning that said there were 
				several tornados that touched down around the area.&nbsp; We 
				will spend a wet windy day on the boat and leave on Monday.&nbsp; 
				Probably there will be a few naps during the day as well.<br />
				<br />
				Our friend Bob and Anne Beck have their boat Baloo in NC and 
				here is his most recent email;<br />
				<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:
EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Bob and Baloo are looking better all the time.&nbsp; 
				It was quite dicey for awhile.&nbsp; The wind started building Friday 
				afternoon.&nbsp; By morning it was blowing 40-50.&nbsp; The eye passed 
				just east about 9 am and then the @#$% hit the fan.&nbsp; We had 
				60-80 for most of Saturday.&nbsp; Water height from 8 ft above to 4 
				ft below average.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had to do some line adjusting - not fun.&nbsp;
				<br />
				Today (Sun) - NICE!</span></div>

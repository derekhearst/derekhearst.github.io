				Visiting with all our friends and relatives has been great.&nbsp; 
				We spent a lot of time with both parents, got to see all of 
				Dean&#39;s family, and Kris&#39;s family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We even 
				spent some time helping Kris&#39;s parents clean out some marmot 
				infestation, but it does get old after a while to not have a 
				place, so we decided to settle down.<br />
				<br />
				To make things more challenging, we had the unfortunate luck for
				<br />
				Dean to get in a car wreck in our brand new to us minivan.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				It was the other drivers fault, and Deans good driving skills 
				turned a wreck that could have been horrible, to a wreck that 
				all could drive away from.&nbsp; That did not mean the car was 
				unscathed though.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 weeks in the body shop, and the 
				van is looking good, but we are still waiting for payment from 
				the other insurance company.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a note to anyone 
				who cares - State Farm has been great to work with through all 
				this but, Farmers Insurance has been horrible.<br />
				<br />
				Well, since we did not find high paying jobs right away, we 
				decided to settle and stop sponging on relative and friends and 
				find a place for us to live as a family again.<br />
				So, here we are in Boise, Idaho.&nbsp; We found an apartment 
				that takes pets, and we have moved in and unpacked.&nbsp; <br />
				Derek has started public High School, and we are back in the 
				realm of monthly bills: rent, insurance, cell phones, 
				television, internet, food, school supplies, clothes, water, 
				electricity, garbage, sewer, and on and on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Boy - 
				did not miss that while we were gone.<br />
				<br />
				Derek is ready to go back to home school, as school takes up 8 
				hours a day with prep and travel time, so he really misses those 
				4 hour a day school times.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is doing well in 
				school so far - taking Conceptual Physics and Engineering design 
				for electives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have very very fast 
				internet here in the apartment, and Derek finally bought the 
				computer of his dreams with the money he saved up - so much free 
				time is spent playing with friends online, and he is also 
				working on youtube videos.<br />
				<br />
				Kris has hit all the temporary staffing agencies in town, 
				looking for work to tie us over until full time good paying jobs 
				can be found.<br />
				<br />
				Dean is enjoying satellite TV sports, and takes Sam for nice 
				walks every day.<br />
				<br />
				The apartment complex has an exercise room, so we try to make it 
				there every day to offset the amount of junk food we eat.<br />

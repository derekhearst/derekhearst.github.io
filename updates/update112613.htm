				It is good to be sailing again and seeing new islands.&nbsp; 
				When the boat moves it reminds you that every now and then you 
				need to pay attention to it, also to put some money into it.
				<br />
				<br />
				We left Grenada bound for St. Lucia and other than a 
				confused/rough seas from Grenada to Carriacou it was looking 
				good.&nbsp; We stopped at Carriacou long enough to look for a 
				fuel barge that was supposedly there and offering diesel at $9 
				EC per gallon.&nbsp; We did not find it so continued north with 
				the other catamaran Pollux and we picked up Windchasers at 
				Carriacou, a single hander who is also headed north.<br />
				<br />
				There was a storm that came through just at dusk and the seas 
				and winds picked up but all three boats did well.&nbsp; Shortly 
				into the night we lost a reefing block, used to keep the sail 
				small due to the high winds.&nbsp; Pollux had some engine 
				problems and Windchasers had no issues.&nbsp; Deciding the best 
				bet was to pull into an anchorage for the night and fix our 
				problems we detoured to Canouan and found a nice protected 
				anchorage for the night.<br />
				<br />
				In the morning everything always looks better and the problems 
				were fixed on both boats.&nbsp; Not wanting to get to St. Lucia 
				too early in the morning we left the anchorage at 12 noon and 
				sailed for most of the day.&nbsp; During the night we had some 
				winds that were not blowing in the right direction for us to 
				sail, so had to motor some of the way.&nbsp; At 6:30 am we 
				pulled into the northern anchorage of Rodney Bay on St. Lucia 
				and dropped the anchor.<br />
				<br />
				Overall it is still good to be moving even with the issues that 
				pop up now and then.&nbsp; It looks like the weather will not be 
				nice to head north until Thursday so we will check in with 
				customs/immigration and do some shopping and site seeing.&nbsp; 
				The anchorage is a protected one and there is some slow internet 
				available so we should stay out of trouble.<br />

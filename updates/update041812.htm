				We rented a car the other day with Bob and Anne of Baloo and 
				went exploring on Long Island.&nbsp; It is an island 76 miles 
				long and at the widest spot is 4 miles but the majority of all 
				sites are located along it&#39;s major two lane road the &quot;Queens 
				Highway&quot;.&nbsp; We wanted to find some of the caves, blue holes, 
				old churches, goats, and the Columbus&#39;s monument listed in our 
				guide book.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				A blue hole is a cave that is inland or an underwater sinkhole, 
				they are also known as vertical caves.&nbsp; The deepest blue 
				hole in the world is &quot;Dean&#39;s Blue Hole&quot; located on Long Island.&nbsp; 
				We knew Dean was &quot;deep&quot; but never thought he was a world record.&nbsp; 
				The water is very blue and you can watch the currents in the 
				hole move the water from the lower colder areas up to the top 
				warmer water.&nbsp; As the sign said, swimming was at your own 
				risk and we decided that it looked better from the shore than in 
				the water.<br />
				<br />
				There are Free diving competitions held at Dean&#39;s Blue Hole and 
				the deepest someone has swam down is 124 meters.&nbsp; There are 
				other types of events where people use weights they can drop or 
				sleds that take them down, with and without fins and the overall 
				deepest someone went is 273 meters.&nbsp; That person also holds 
				the record for holding his breath in a pool for 11 minutes 35 
				seconds.&nbsp; Ok so when we are snorkeling down 15 feet for 20 
				seconds I guess no one is that amazed.&nbsp; As you cruise you 
				are always looking for fish to spear or lobsters to harvest and 
				you can build up the time you are underwater but no where near 
				the 11 minutes.<br />
				<br />
				At the north end of Long Island is a Columbus monument, it seems 
				one of his ships, Santa Maria, ran aground during is voyage to 
				the new world.&nbsp; Bob and Anne thought they could help his 
				navigation by pointing the direction he should go but there 
				seemed to be a bit of confusion&nbsp; as well so I am glad he 
				did not ask us for directions.&nbsp; We also had the opportunity 
				to see if we could compete with the NASCAR tire changing pit 
				crew.&nbsp; With all the gravel, sand, some asphalt roads we 
				ended up with a flat tire.&nbsp; As you can see we were helping 
				Derek&#39;s education on the finer details of how to change a flat 
				tire.<br />
				<br />
				There are many caves as well on Long Island and we did some 
				spelunking in a few of them.&nbsp; Most had bats, cockroaches, 
				and other things we only got side glimpses of but no one was 
				lost.&nbsp; Finding the cave location became quite a challenge, 
				they are mentioned in the island guides but there are no signs 
				or really good references on how to find them.&nbsp; For 
				instance one said, turn at the house, go down the road two 
				minutes, walk along the shore 50 paces and then turn east into 
				the forest.&nbsp; With Kris and Bob navigating we did manage to 
				find our fair share of caves but we did not find all of them, I 
				guess another trip might be in order.<br />
				<br />
				All in all we packed a lot into one day but you could not see 
				Long Island just from the water so being able to drive it made a 
				lot of sense.&nbsp; Oh yea they drive on the left side of the 
				road so after stopping it was important to start on the correct 
				side of the road.</div>

				We arrived in St. Martin / Sint Maarten on January 4th, late in 
				the day.&nbsp; We went out or a nice lunch the following day, 
				and relaxed, and then the work started.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				When we lost our shroud in Grenada, we replaced both shrouds and 
				thought we were done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a few days later, we 
				noticed that the wood trim on the door that leads from the 
				starboard bath to the V-berth, had a gap in it, that was never 
				there before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thought that perhaps we had 
				tightened the rig a bit too tight and deformed the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				We kept an eye on the gap, and it did not seem to become larger, 
				so we figured we were OK.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the other doorframe 
				on the starboard side got a gap, and then we noticed a small 
				crack in the Formica that covers the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				O.K. - time to get serious about the matter.<br />
				<br />
				We started taking all the trim work off, which included the door 
				frames, the nice white smooth Formica covering the walls, and 
				the headline, which is a vinyl fabric, glued to foam, and glued 
				to a thin sheet of plywood.&nbsp; What we found, gave us a 
				frown.&nbsp; The nidacore (honeycomb structure), had cracked and 
				there was a 1/2&quot; gap in our &quot;structural&quot; bulkhead.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Now we say structural, but it wasn&#39;t really originally fiber 
				glassed to be that structural, but it later boats they must have 
				found an issue, because they beefed up the wall thickness and 
				added more fiberglass on later models.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were 
				not too concerned, because we had sailed from Grenada to St. 
				Martin with the breakage, and had taken on some very high winds 
				and big seas, and had no further breakage, so this particular 
				break was obviously only part of the structure - - but still we 
				needed to fix it.<br />
				<br />
				This looked outside our talent area, so we asked around and 
				found out a recommend place called Custom Fit Marine to do the 
				work.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were lucky that they had time to work on 
				our boat, as they are quite busy, but they got us in.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				We moved to a dock out the Time Out Boat Yard, which is where 
				Custom Fit is located, and ended up tied up to the boat that the 
				owner of the company lives on&nbsp; - how convenient.<br />
				<br />
				Everyone at the boat yard was very nice, and our experience 
				there was as pleasant as it could be, with half the boat torn 
				apart and grinding and sanding going on.&nbsp; We decided not 
				only to fix the bulkhead that broke, but reinforce the same 
				bulkhead on the port side as well, so both hulls were&nbsp; more 
				than a bit messy for 4 days, but it was worth it as now the boat 
				is stronger than ever.&nbsp; To save some money, we decided to 
				do the final finish work of putting varathane on all the wood 
				work, and installing the ceiling panels and putting all the 
				lighting back in. We won&#39;t have the job completely done for 
				another month probably.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				As long as we were in the money spending mood, we purchased a 
				new forestay and also hired the local rigging shop to come out 
				and &quot;tune&quot; the rig.&nbsp; Which means adjusting the tension on 
				all the rig on the boat.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We did have time for some fun while in St. Martin.&nbsp; We went 
				out to lunch with Pollux one day, and had some of the best food 
				we had eaten in a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact it was so good 
				we had to go back.&nbsp; Dean ordered pizza both times (boring).&nbsp; 
				But Derek had an out of this world Salmon and seafood lasagna, 
				so we went back for it, but they did not have it, as it was a 
				special.&nbsp; So Derek got a salmon steak with creamy seafood 
				sauce, and Kris got a salmon steak stuffed with sea scallops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Kris and Derek both wanted to go back again, but the restaurant 
				was on the pricey side, so we only did twice.&nbsp;&nbsp; With 
				the work on the boat, lunch on board was a bit lucky, so we did 
				make it to McDonalds twice, and then one of our favorite places 
				from last time, Sarafina&#39;s, pastry shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Another fun thing folks do in St. Martin is to stand at the end 
				of the runway to the airport, and get blown away by jet wash.&nbsp; 
				We made the trip with Pollux, Day Dreamer, and Windchasers.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The first jet took all by surprise as the jet wash flings sand 
				at you like a sandblaster would, and anything not secured down 
				will blow away, like Pollux found with their waterproof bag that 
				was sitting on the ground.&nbsp; Good thing it was empty, so no 
				loss there.&nbsp; Derek got a thorough sandblasting, but Kris 
				and Dean were smart enough to stand slightly aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				We were also able to watch a 747-400 fly in, which is one big 
				plane, especially when it is only a few hundred feet above your 
				head.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				St. Martin was unfortunately a place for goodbyes as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Windchasers has his boat for sale, and will not be leaving St. 
				Martin - and good for him, it looks like it might be sold, so he 
				can head back to South America and rejoin his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				We will miss sailing side by side with Windchasers as we were 
				pretty equally matched sailing, and it drove us to be better 
				sailors when sailing alongside.<br />
				<br />
				The other goodbye is to Day Dreamer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have 
				spent a lot of time with them, and they are good close friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				They are also not heading any further north at this time, and 
				will be in St. Martin for&nbsp; a couple of months, with no 
				plans at this time to take the boat any further north.&nbsp;We 
				have been around Day Dreamer for over 6 months, seeing them 
				almost daily, so they will be missed.<br />
				<br />
				We got together with Windchasers, Day Dreamer, Pollux and us for 
				a goodbye potluck, which was fun, but also sad.<br />

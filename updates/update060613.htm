				We decided to do a couple of more tours in Dominica.&nbsp; We 
				took a tour of Syndicate Falls, which was a 30 minute drive up 
				into the mountains on twisty steep roads.&nbsp; In the United 
				States, most roads are a 12% grade or less.&nbsp; Here in 
				Dominica, 12% would not even be considered a hill.&nbsp; The 
				roads are twisty and steep.&nbsp; The taxi driver honks before 
				each hairpin turn to let the folks coming the other way know, 
				because generally some of the roads are not really quite big 
				enough for two cars.&nbsp; We made it to the top all right and 
				took a short hike to the falls.&nbsp; The falls at one time was 
				closed because a downstream town used the water for drinking, 
				but now they pipe it from above the falls, so we all took a 
				quick dip in the water, but the falls were toooo strong to swim 
				into, so we just got wet and cold - yes cold, with a wind coming 
				off the falls it was quite chilly.&nbsp; We also saw some 
				beautiful flora on the way to the falls, and also got to see 
				nutmeg, which we had never seen before. <br />
				<br />
				After the falls, we walked through the rain forest in a nature 
				preserve.&nbsp; The trees are really large, not so tall, but big 
				around, especially the base, which you could easily hide in the 
				folds of the base and roots.&nbsp; The base/roots fold and bend 
				around with nice shapes.<br />
				<br />
				That evening, we attended a beach BBQ with all the other boats 
				in the anchorage, hosted by the &quot;boat boys&quot;.&nbsp; They cooked 
				up rice and salad and chicken and mahi mahi, and of course rum 
				punch.&nbsp; All you can eat for $20 per person.&nbsp; The food 
				was delicious, and most folks had a few too many rum punches.&nbsp; 
				Derek always enjoys adults making fools of themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				There was music as well, and most enjoyed a dance or two. (no - 
				Dean and Derek did not dance, but Kris did).&nbsp; A couple of 
				more boats with kids were in the anchorage, so Derek had a good 
				time with kids again.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We decided to take another tour with another boat from the 
				anchorage named Saralane.&nbsp; Skip and Madeline had taken a 
				bus to a pool the other day, but it was raining so hard, they 
				were hesitant to cross the fast running river without knowing 
				how long the rain would last - which was smart because the 
				rivers here become raging torrents in a good rain.&nbsp; We 
				decided to head up with them again and see if we could make it 
				to the pool.&nbsp;&nbsp; We took a bus, which dropped us off at 
				the small town of Bense, and after asking a couple of locals 
				about how much rain they had up there, we decided to go ahead 
				and hike to the pool.&nbsp; About one mile into the two mile 
				hike a fellow named Jackson caught up with us.&nbsp; The locals 
				were concerned about us, and asked Jackson a local guide to 
				check on us.&nbsp;&nbsp; A good thing they did, and crossing a 
				couple of the rivers was a bit tricky.&nbsp; We got to the pool, 
				and Jackson and Skip took the plunge.&nbsp; Well, Kris and 
				Madeline were thinking no way -&nbsp; but Derek wanted to.&nbsp; 
				Kris promised that if Derek went she would go - and to her 
				dismay, Derek jumped from the 20&#39; cliff into the pool.&nbsp; 
				Jackson was really great, and gave everyone a brief safety 
				lecture before they jumped.&nbsp; Although Kris and Madeline did 
				not want to, they both gathered their courage and made the jump, 
				which was fun, but both agreed once was enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Derek made 4 or 5 more jumps before he was done.<br />
				<br />
				We enjoyed another beach potluck and BBQ the next night, and got 
				directions to a small hot springs pool from Saralane.&nbsp; A 
				short trek lead us to the pool, which was fun to see, but a bit 
				warm to stay in too long.<br />
				<br />
				We have really enjoyed Dominica, and have not gone to all the 
				sights by far, but weather beckons once again, so we will say 
				goodbye for now, and head off to Martinique.</div>

				It is close to being Christmas, but it does not seem like it 
				really is the holiday season.&nbsp; We have not heard the 
				assortment of holiday music from the radio since we don&#39;t listen 
				to local radio.&nbsp; No ads on TV advertising toys and 
				specials, since we don&#39;t watch TV.&nbsp; The stores do not have 
				many&nbsp; holiday decorations up here in Guadeloupe, certainly 
				nothing like the U.S. does, and of course the weather is warm 
				and sunny, not cold and snowy.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is the season 
				for joy and giving, and we wish all of you a Very Merry 
				Christmas!<br />
				<br />
				Currently we are at the northern point of Guadeloupe at the 
				anchorage of Deshaies.&nbsp; Our plans are to head south 9 miles 
				to Pigeon Point and meet up with several other boats for 
				Christmas.&nbsp; The kids have exchanged names for secret Santa 
				and everyone will get together for a snack time as well.&nbsp; 
				We had been at Pigeon Point but there wasn&#39;t any internet so we 
				moved up to Deshaies so we can make some Skype calls to friends 
				and family.<br />
				<br />
				Back at Pigeon Point, we hope to have some sunny weather and 
				snorkel and maybe dive in the Jacques Cousteau Marine Park 
				there, but the weather looks rainy, so we shall see.<br />
				<br />
				We spent some time in Les Saintes, where we said goodbye to our 
				friends on Moana Roa - it is always hard to say goodbye, and 
				unfortunately, the next few months will hold a couple of more 
				for us.&nbsp; At Les Saintes, we hiked up a hill and explored a 
				fort, and just spent time with friends.&nbsp; And ate baguettes 
				of course!<br />

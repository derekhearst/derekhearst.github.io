				One of the benefits of home schooling is you can customize the 
				class and home work based upon the needs of your student.&nbsp; 
				Sometimes that means extra work or time in specific areas, and 
				other times it might mean less time on a subject because it is 
				understood early in the lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how does 
				all this relate to wind surfing you ask?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
				Well as we anchored off Gilligan&#39;s Island we were visited by
				<span class="style1"><span class="style2">Geard</span></span>, a local wind surfer who lives 
				on the beach in the same anchorage.&nbsp; One of his favorite 
				things to do is help others learn and enjoy the sport of wind 
				surfing.&nbsp; Over the last year he and his wife, Toni, have 
				had 100 friends and family stay at his house as well as those 
				that happen to be in the anchorage and want to learn the sport.&nbsp; 
				He has over a dozen boards, sails, masts, and equipment for all 
				levels and wind conditions.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				So when <span class="style1"><span class="style2">Geard</span></span> offered to teach 
				Derek,&nbsp; and Kyler off &quot;Good Trade&quot; wind surfing, we decided 
				that an extra day in the anchorage was worth it.&nbsp; Now we 
				had not made wind surfing a part of the school program but it 
				seemed like a change in the curriculum would be in order.&nbsp; 
				So for the day of 2/27/13 Derek and Kyler spent the day falling 
				into the water, learning about the wind and balance on a board, 
				and finally sailing into the bay.&nbsp; Now they probably 
				thought it was not school, but it was a new teacher, new idea, 
				and new style of teaching that they had to work with.&nbsp; In 
				the end they were able to stand on the board, sail it on one 
				tack and then return to the beach.&nbsp; Not bad for a school 
				day :)<br />

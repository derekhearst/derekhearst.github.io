				As we left Guadeloupe for Les Saintes, we had seen on the beach 
				a bunch of boats getting ready to race.&nbsp; We ended up motor 
				sailing to Les Saintes, but the boats followed us all racing.&nbsp; 
				The next day, they left from Les Saintes and headed back to 
				Guadeloupe after a rather loud beach party that night.<br />
				<br />
				We did not spend long in Les Saintes and headed off to Dominica 
				before the winds got too bad.&nbsp; We had a bit of a rough sail 
				mostly into the wind, with 5 to 6 foot seas, with occasional 12 
				footers.&nbsp; Good old &quot;What If&quot; and crew handled it all in stride 
				and arrived safely in Dominica.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				With every new island we visit, Kris makes sure that all the 
				paperwork that we need for Sam is in line, and tries to contact 
				the island in advance to make sure all is right.&nbsp; It really paid 
				off here in Dominica.&nbsp; When Dean checked in with Customs and 
				Immigration he checked a box saying we had a dog, but they did 
				not ask for paperwork or anything.&nbsp; Later when we took Sam in 
				for a walk, we did not make it past the end of the dock before 
				we were stopped and asked for the paperwork.&nbsp; We showed the 
				&quot;import permit&quot; that was emailed to us ahead of time, and were 
				allowed to proceed.&nbsp; We were later stopped in town by a local 
				and were advised to make sure we had our papers, or the dog 
				would be taken and destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later at a park we were asked 
				again.&nbsp; Out of all the countries with strict rules, it seems 
				odd, that here, in one of the poorest everyone has been more 
				informed of the laws, and follow up on them.<br />
				<br />
				When you arrive in Dominica, about a mile out, a fellow in a 
				long wood boat with outboard will come up alongside you and 
				introduce himself and tell you welcome to Dominica.&nbsp; He will ask 
				if you need help anchoring, or help getting a mooring, and if 
				you say no, he will later stop by your boat after you are 
				anchored to see if you need anything, or would like to take a 
				tour.&nbsp;&nbsp; The men are very pleasant and professional.&nbsp; Dominica 
				has made this system up to provide jobs to folks where cruisers 
				stop, and provide security in the anchorage.&nbsp; It is actually 
				quite nice, since the men are not pushy at all, and you find out 
				more about things than you could on your own.&nbsp; Our guide is 
				Lawrence, and his boat Lawrence of Arabia.&nbsp; We hired Lawrence to 
				take us on a tour up the Indian River.&nbsp; Motors are not allowed 
				on the river due to the damage they due to the ecosystem.&nbsp; 
				Lawrence came out to the boat, picked us up and took us on a 
				very nice tour, explaining and naming the flora and fauna as he 
				went.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one of the folks who does the tour has to take and 
				pass a test to be able to explain the flora and fauna, before 
				they can give the tours of island attractions. <br />
				<br />
				One of the attractions on the river is small shack, which was 
				used for filming a scene in Pirates of the Caribbean number 
				two.&nbsp; If you have watched the movie, you will remember a scene 
				where people are standing in a river at night, with many lighted 
				candles as the movie stars row to a shack that &quot;Calypso&quot; live 
				in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite a bit of movie filming for the Pirates of the 
				Caribbean was done on Dominica.<br />
				<br />
				At the end of the river there is a small restaurant/bar, which 
				we did not stop at because it was 8:00 in the morning, but we 
				did take a hike to visit a local plantation and see all the 
				items grown there.&nbsp; The plantation is quite interesting, as it 
				is 7 acres perched on the hillside and slope.&nbsp; Some is terraced 
				and some not.&nbsp; They grew a large variety of items.&nbsp; We saw: 
				bananas, guava, passion fruit, mangoes, breadfruit, pineapple, 
				avocadoes, okra, cabbage, cinnamon, cacao and limes.&nbsp; We were 
				given mangoes to take back, and purchased some bananas, mangoes 
				and okra.&nbsp; We tired raw cacao.&nbsp; Derek was gagging to get some in 
				his mouth, because raw cacao looks a bit and feels a bit like 
				slimy intestine; however when you put the seed in your mouth and 
				suck on it, it has a pleasant sweet tangy flavor, although quite 
				slimy.&nbsp; We learned that they use the cacao seeds here not for 
				chocolate, but they make cacao tea from the seeds.&nbsp; We also 
				learned that&nbsp; bananas take 9 months from when they are planted 
				to produce fruit, and then 3 months for fruit to grow.&nbsp; They 
				then cut down the plant, and a new stalk grows up out of the 
				old.&nbsp; The rotate timing, and produce bananas year round here, 
				most all sold to Europe.<br />
				<br />
				We also took a tour of Fort Shirley, a British fort that really 
				never saw battle, but the Dominicans have done a great job on 
				restoring the fort which was abandoned in 1854, and restoration 
				not started until 1989.&nbsp; That is&nbsp; lot of time for the jungle to 
				reclaim the land, which it did.&nbsp; We had a nice hike to the top 
				of the hill, and wandering around the restored parts of the 
				fort.<br />
				<br />
				We plan on one more tour to go see and swim in a waterfall 
				before we leave.</div>

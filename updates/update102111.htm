				When Irene came through we were tucked away up in the C&amp;D cannel 
				and saw very little of the winds, waves and tidal surge.&nbsp; 
				Others were not as fortunate, the communities of Oriental and 
				Beaufort, NC show move of the impact.&nbsp; We saw 45 foot sail 
				boats a 100 yards away from the water and a good 6 feet out of 
				the water.&nbsp; Here in the anchorage we see 7 boats that have 
				been damaged and are either on shore or floating with major 
				repair ahead of them.&nbsp; Talking to people here they saw a 
				8.5 tidal surge, had winds of 80 mph&nbsp; and lots of water 
				front property that went under.<br />
				<br />
				One of the projects we have on the boat is installing a water 
				maker in the port forward locker.&nbsp; When working on a boat 
				you always hate to drill into the hull because there is a bunch 
				of water on the other side and if you drill too deep, well it is 
				not a good thing.&nbsp; A way to work around this is by epoxying; 
				bonding, wood to the inside of the hull and then attaching your 
				items to the piece of wood.&nbsp; Bob B off the boat Baloo is an 
				&quot;expert&quot; with epoxy so he took the time to teach Dean how to do 
				it.&nbsp; Once the wood has been bonded to the boat it will not 
				come off so you need to make sure it is right the first time.&nbsp; 
				The project went off with out issues and Dean only has one that 
				was slightly off target, practice practice pratice.<br />
				<br />
				Kris has been doing some work as well, but with rather 
				disastrous results.&nbsp; Dean has been wanting her to hook the 
				GPS (global positioning system) which gives us latitude and 
				longitude coordinates and time to our VHF (very high frequency) 
				radio.&nbsp; The new VHF radios have a button you can&nbsp; push 
				if in distress, and they will send out a constant message with 
				your GPS coordinates.<br />
				Kris usually does good wiring, but in this case hooked up a wire 
				wrong, and fried the VHF.&nbsp; Oh Well, a new VHF isn&#39;t that 
				much money :(<br />
				<br />
				It has been great catching up with our friends Bob and Anne on 
				Baloo.&nbsp; We first met them in Tacoma, WA when they were 
				getting ready to go cruising at the same time that we were on 
				our first cruise to Mexico.&nbsp; They had two young boys at the 
				time.&nbsp; Now they have a bigger boat, no kids and a nice 
				heater on board, and now we have the kid, and no heater.&nbsp;
				<br />
				<br />
				We will be leaving tomorrow and heading out onto the big blue 
				ocean for a sail down to Wrightsville Beach, N.C.&nbsp; We 
				should have nice north winds, but cold weather.&nbsp; After that 
				we will take the ICW down to Cape Fear, Bald Head Island were we 
				promised Derek a night at the marina so he can see Bald Head 
				Island.&nbsp; Kris, Lee and Norm stopped there on the way up 
				delivering the boat and after Derek learned that you can only 
				ride golf carts on the island, he was hooked.&nbsp; So a night 
				there with a golf cart rental is in the plan.<br />
				After that we will make our way down to Charleston, S.C either 
				on the outside or on the ICW depending on weather.<br />

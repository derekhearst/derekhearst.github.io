				So we have sailed to Guadeloupe and anchored at the north end as 
				well as the south end and now checking out &quot;Les Saintes Island&quot;.&nbsp; 
				Guadeloupe is French and very very little English is spoken.&nbsp; 
				We have gotten by with pointing and smiling and so far 
				everything has worked out.&nbsp; Lots of rugged mountains and 
				usually some rain at some point in the day.<br />
				<br />
				Our message is about Bs, the first B to talk about is <strong>B</strong>ackpacking.&nbsp; 
				While we were anchored at Deshaies we happened to take the walk 
				up the creek to see the water falls.&nbsp; We did take a 
				backpack because the walk up was a two hour hike so we needed 
				lunch and some water.&nbsp; Maybe we could have done without the 
				water since we were hiking in the creek but you never know what 
				was in the water so we were safe and took our own.&nbsp; The 
				hike was in the water, along the creek, on the side of the bank, 
				and then though the brush as well.&nbsp; No really clear trail 
				to follow other than the stream but we did get to the end where 
				the waterfall was at and disappeared into a &quot;cave&quot; like opening.&nbsp; 
				The trip back was much quicker because there was a paved road we could 
				walk on back to the dingy.&nbsp; Not sure I would rate the total 
				trip over a&nbsp; 5 but we did get some exercise and Sam was 
				tuckered out.&nbsp; It was a good way to spend 4 hours of the 
				day.<br />
				<br />
				Since we are in a French country you can not go anywhere with out a 
				<strong>B</strong>aguette: a loaf of bread maybe 2 to 3 inches in diameter and about 2 feet 
				long.&nbsp; You can slice them thin for dinner and make garlic 
				bread.&nbsp; You can slice a six inch piece and then cut it 
				length wise for a sandwich.&nbsp; You find then in every 
				grocery store or bakery and everyone is usually buying them in 
				the morning and carrying several home.<br />
				<br />
				We made it down to the south end and anchored off Basse Terre 
				for an evening.&nbsp; Since this is the second largest city on the 
				island we thought it would be a good spot to get some of our 
				difficult food items to find.&nbsp; We stopped at a local restaurant 
				to see if we could find a taxi ride.&nbsp; One lady at the 
				restaurant spoke a little English, so after much talking in 
				French and a few English words, we figured out that one of the 
				waitresses would give us a ride to the big grocery store when 
				she had a work break at 3:00, but could not bring us back.&nbsp; 
				We were confident that we could find a way back somehow, so off 
				we went.&nbsp; After buying our items at the grocery store, 
				which was a challenge in itself, as everything was in French, 
				and some things took some deciphering to decide if it was really 
				what we wanted, we tried to have the help desk get us a 
				taxi but to no avail.&nbsp; The nice lady at the help desk 
				called about five places, but for some reason, no taxi was to be 
				had.&nbsp; Again this is all done with little 
				English/French being spoken but lots of nods and smiles.&nbsp; 
				Since no taxis were going to come the option of a <strong>b</strong>us ride was 
				next.&nbsp; We happened to get to the bus stop five minutes 
				prior to the bus arriving and in our limited vocabulary asked 
				the bus driver if the bus went towards where we wanted.&nbsp; We made it down to the bus depot with 
				out issue.&nbsp; At the bus depot we had to find the next bus 
				and then wait 30 minutes for it to arrive but we we made it back to 
				the boat warm and dry.&nbsp; It is amazing what you can do with 
				a vocabulary of about 5 French words and lots of pantomiming and 
				smiles.<br />
				<br />
				The beach off of our anchorage is made of of sand that is 
				<strong>b</strong>lack/dark.&nbsp; We have seen the &quot;normal&quot; beach color and a 
				pink beach so now a black beach seems like the next logical 
				step.&nbsp; Not sure if the sand has any health benefits but it 
				seems like there are people swimming along the shore all the 
				time.<br />
				<br />
				Our last B is for the<strong> b</strong>oat race we saw as we 
				left Basse Terre and headed for Les Saintes Island.&nbsp; In the 
				pictures of the black sand beach you can see some of the boats 
				on the beach getting ready for the race.&nbsp; These boats look 
				like the ones we watched in the Bahamas but on these they do not 
				use a board to sit out over the water.&nbsp; The boats are about 
				25&#39; long, with a huge mainsail as you can see in the pictures.&nbsp; 
				The race was 10 miles, with 9 miles of open ocean into the wind 
				all the way.&nbsp; These guys take their sailing seriously.&nbsp; 
				When we left the anchorage the boats were not in the water but 
				we did see them sail through the anchorage at Les Saintes later 
				in the day.<br />
				<br />
				We will spend a few days here in Les Saintes, before heading off 
				to Dominica for more adventures.&nbsp; At least they speak 
				English in Dominica - we think???</div>

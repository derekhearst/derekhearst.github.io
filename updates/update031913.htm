				It is a big circle out there, you never know when you will run 
				into people or when you might re-meet whose folks again.&nbsp; Last year we went through hurricane Irene at the dock on the C &amp; D 
				canal.&nbsp; In the next slip was a Cal 39 sailboat called &quot;Moma Cal&quot;, and the two 
				folks on it were Doug and Cherry.&nbsp; We spent several days 
				with them as the hurricane came and went but then moved on our 
				way and they went theirs.&nbsp; Our paths never crossed but we tried to stay in touch 
				with their blog and they watched our web site.&nbsp; A week or 
				so ago it happened that we both ended up in Puerto Rico; Salinas and 
				now in Fajardo.&nbsp; It is fun to catch up with people you have met 
				and find out their travels and adventures and compare it to yours. 
				It is amazing how many&nbsp; people and places you have in 
				common.<br />
				<br />
				We went out to the island of Vieques and only toured the western 
				end, the weather was not going to cooperate so we did not tour 
				the entire island.&nbsp; It is part of the Spanish Virgin Islands and does not get many cruisers 
				stopping at it.&nbsp; We ended up spending two nights there and 
				one day snorkeling where we saw two rays, both at least 3&#39; 
				across and 6&#39; long - beautiful creatures to keep your distance 
				from.<br />
				<br />
				From there we motored sailed up to Fajardo which is on the north 
				eastern tip of Puerto Rico.&nbsp; The town has several marine 
				stores that we wanted to check out, a few more purchases needed 
				to be made.&nbsp; It was also a good spot to anchor for the bad 
				weather to go by.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				One item on Kris&#39;s list of to do&#39;s was to fix a diesel leak on 
				the port engine.&nbsp; It has been slowly leaking diesel out out 
				of the fuel injection pump, and Kris was tired of cleaning up, 
				containing, and smelling the diesel.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a 
				worry-some project because she had to remove the fuel injection 
				pump to replace some o rings and washers that were failing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this sounds easy 
				-&nbsp; it is identified in 
				the Volvo manual as a project to have the &quot;licensed technician&quot; 
				do.&nbsp; After checking with the <em>Engine Guru</em> Brian back in 
				Connecticut, Kris did the work and everything went O.K.&nbsp;- 
				unless you count the fact that one of the parts she thought she 
				absolutely should not separate, got accidently separated.&nbsp; 
				We put the pump back in and tried to start the engine and guess 
				what - it actually tried to start.<br />
				<br />
				The motor turned over and Kris was bleeding the injectors and 
				then the motor did not want to turn over.&nbsp; It sounded like 
				the battery did not have enough juice but we traded batteries 
				with the other engine and had the second engine supplying power 
				to the first engine&#39;s battery so that wasn&#39;t it.&nbsp; 
				Of course it was Friday night, so no help until Monday.<br />
				<br />
				After several restless nights Kris called Brian and went through 
				the issues, even made the engine noises over the phone to see if that would 
				help diagnose the problem.&nbsp; So Brian gave Kris a few items 
				to check and that still didn&#39;t fix anything.&nbsp; Kris 
				called Brian back and held the phone to the engine, and Brian 
				said he though it was electrical.&nbsp; So Kris started working 
				on the electrical system and low and behold changing the relays did make a difference and the engine started 
				right up.&nbsp; Now Kris had not touched the relay and none of 
				the work that had been done was around the relay but that was 
				the issue.&nbsp; As Kris said &quot;Brian is the Engine Guru and has 
				saved the day again&quot;.<br />
				<br />
				For those of you have ever seen the movie &quot;Captain Ron&quot; you may 
				remember a few lines from the movie, but we have several line 
				memorized because they hold a truth for us.&nbsp; One of the 
				lines is &quot;If anything&#39;s going to happen, its going to happen out 
				there.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is how we have felt lately, with 
				sucking salt water into the engine, the autopilot failure, the 
				main winch failure, the engine diesel leak, a small issue with 
				antifreeze on the other engine, and our battery selector switch 
				failing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to Kris all she has done is work 
				on the boat for the last couple of months - but the other side 
				to the line &quot;If anything&#39;s going to happen, its going to happen 
				out there.&quot; - is the people we have spent time with, the 
				snorkeling and views we have seen, the adventures on land, and 
				time,&nbsp; (good and bad) spent with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				All of these things would never happen if we just stayed at 
				dock.<br />
				By the way if you haven&#39;t seen the movie - go rent it.<br />

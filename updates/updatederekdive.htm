				<p class="MsoNormal">For my birthday I really wanted to go scuba 
				diving.&nbsp; Mom and Dad talked to Dive Exuma and found I could 
				take an introductory dive with&nbsp; out being certified.&nbsp; I meet 
				the dive boat and went to the &quot;Blue Hole&quot; in anchorage #3 on 
				Stocking Island near George Town Bahamas.&nbsp; A blue hole is 
				just that, a deep hole that goes down in the middle of shallower 
				water.&nbsp; The blue hole I dove at goes down about 60 feet.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">First they walked me through the safety 
				procedures, made sure I understood what was going to happen and 
				then they loaded me up with the tank, regulator and BC.&nbsp; It 
				sure weighed a lot in the boat but once I was in the water it 
				did not weigh anything.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">My dive master talked to me on the surface 
				and then we slowly sank beneath the boat.&nbsp; We went slowly 
				down the line because by ears took awhile to adjust to the 
				pressure changes.&nbsp; Finally we reached the bottom and knelt 
				on the bottom.&nbsp; I did not have enough weight so kept 
				floating up even though my BC was out of air.&nbsp; Even with 
				that issue I worked with my dive master on how to clear my mask, 
				clear the mouth piece with air, and then we took a fun trip 
				around the area.</p>
				I saw a really big fish about 2 feet and a foot big sea 
				cucumber, sea cucumbers are black and mostly in nooks and crannies 
				they shoot water out of themselves as protection.&nbsp; I went 
				down to 40 feet and at 32 feet you have to wait a minute when 
				you are going up so you can get the nitrogen out of your body.
				<br />
				<br />
				I was nervous before we got into the water and then a bit as we 
				went down but after awhile I had a great time. Now I have to 
				convince my parents to do more diving.&nbsp; On 3/27/12 it looks 
				like mom and I are going to do a reef dive.&nbsp; If all goes 
				well we might even do two dives that day but I will tell you 
				about it later.<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

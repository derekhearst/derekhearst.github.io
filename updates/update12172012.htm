				We left Miami on Wednesday the 12th at 11:30 p.m along with our 
				friends on &quot;Good Trade&quot;.&nbsp; We motor&nbsp; sailed across to North 
				Bimini Island in the Bahamas and arrived by 9:30 a.m. on the 
				13th.&nbsp; After the guys went town and did all the official 
				paperwork, we all headed in to town and got a new Sim card for 
				the phones so we could have cell phone coverage in the Bahamas.&nbsp; 
				The boys went for a quick swim at the dock, as the clear water 
				was just too tempting to resist.&nbsp; A quick lunch and then we 
				headed out a gain to catch favorable winds for&nbsp; a long 150 
				mile passage next.<br />
				<br />
				Unfortunately, the winds although good 
				for sailing, were strong and built the seas up to an 
				uncomfortable rocking and rolling sail all night long.&nbsp; We 
				had 3 to 5 foot seas on the beam, which the boat rolls up and 
				down quite nicely, but about every 10th sea or so gets out of 
				whack and slams into the side of the boat and up underneath 
				causing a lurch and loud bang which is very unpleasant.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
				About 3:00 in the morning of the 14th a squall came through and 
				the wind shifted to off the nose so Kris went to start up the 
				engine to help motor through the squall and could not get the 
				engine on port to start, but did get the starboard engine 
				started.&nbsp; As it was dark, loud, rocky and Dean was 
				sleeping, she didn&#39;t worry about it then, but decided to worry 
				about it in the morning.&nbsp; Come morning, seas still bad and 
				getting worse, the engine was tried again, and all it did was 
				turn just a bit, then seize up and not move.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				seas were too rough to work on anything then, and Kris was 
				afraid that if she did try to work on the engine, not only would 
				she have the engine to fix, but also vomit to clean up off the 
				engine.<br />
				After sailing 26 hours in unpleasant conditions, we could 
				finally change course and head more downwind for the last 5 
				hours and had a pleasant sail and anchored at Highborne Cay in 
				the Bahamas.<br />
				&nbsp; <br />
				We all had a well deserved good nights sleep, but in the morning 
				the anchorage was a bit rolly, so we pressed on, and had a nice 
				sail down to Pipe Cay in the Bahamas, were we found a nice quiet 
				anchorage.&nbsp; Our friends on &quot;Good Trade&quot; made the trip with 
				us.<br />
				<br />
				When Kris looked at the engine the next morning, we were quite 
				dismayed to find out that we had seawater backed up into the 
				engine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris started working while Dean and Derek 
				took Sam to shore.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
				One great thing about the cruising community is the willingness 
				of others to help out when a crisis occurs.&nbsp; Our friends on 
				&quot;Good Trade&quot; were kind enough to offer the use of their phone to 
				call a mechanic for advice when our phone couldn&#39;t get a signal, 
				and they freely offered what advice they could give.&nbsp; Our 
				friends on &quot;Full Monty&quot; were within radio distance and a quick 
				call to them and Will gave us some great advice from his years 
				of working on engines, that&nbsp; did the trick and got our 
				engine running again.&nbsp; We could not have got it done that 
				quickly, or maybe not at all without their help and we greatly 
				appreciated it.<br />
				<br />
				We got the work on the engine done and got it started up.&nbsp; 
				For those of you who are unfamiliar with diesel engines - 
				getting salt water in your engine has one of two results - one 
				result is to get the engine started again - the other result is 
				to use the engine as a large chunk of worthless metal that does 
				nothing.&nbsp; We were most happy to get the first result.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Evidently the hard pounding forced water back up the exhaust 
				pipe and into the engine - something to be aware of for next 
				time.&nbsp; We have run the engine and done two oil changes, 
				with a couple of more oil changes to come until we we feel like 
				we got all the water out.&nbsp; Good thing we stocked up on oil 
				and filters in the states.<br />
				&nbsp; <br />
				Dean and Derek had a good time snorkeling with &quot;Good Trade&quot; 
				while Kris babied the engine, and Derek got his first lionfish 
				with the spear gun.&nbsp; We will celebrate the engine work and 
				snorkeling with a nice Periwinkle chowder tonight with our 
				friends on &quot;Good Trade&quot;</div>

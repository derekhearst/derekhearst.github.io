				We realize it is mid December and some places are experiencing 
				snow, ice storms and&nbsp; cold weather (-20 degrees F), and 
				your typical winter weather conditions.&nbsp; Since we are 
				further south our weather has been different; high temp still in 
				the mid 80s,&nbsp;&nbsp; low temp mid 70s, a bit more windy 
				which makes for a cooler night but overall it has been very 
				enjoyable, that was until we arrived in Dominica.<br />
				<br />
				The weather was predicted to become nasty out of the 
				east/northeast with high winds which would make the seas 8 to 10 
				foot.&nbsp; So the plan was to make it to Dominica and enjoy the 
				protected anchorage and see the island.&nbsp; There are probably 20 
				other cruising boats here as well all with the same idea.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We made it to Dominica just fine, and our first day was great.&nbsp; 
				Before the rain started,&nbsp; Kris had taken Jen off &quot;Pollux&quot;, 
				and &quot;Sonia&quot; of Moana Roa to a local hot spring we knew of, and 
				the girls had a nice hot soak in their &quot;private spa&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<br />
				<br />
				Then next day, everyone decided to go take a hike at the local 
				fort.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris and Derek did not go, as Derek has 
				sprained his neck while doing flips and dives off of Pollux.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				That day it dumped rain.<br />
				<br />
				Most of the time the rain storms will come through and dump for 
				5 to 10 minutes and then the sun comes out and maybe another 
				storm comes through later in the day.&nbsp; The rain dumped for hours 
				on end then a short 5 to 10 minute sunny spot and then back to 
				rain.&nbsp; If any boat that has a rain catcher for their fresh water 
				tanks has already topped off their tanks and is looking for ways 
				to clean the boat or do laundry with the excess water.&nbsp; Rain is 
				nice, but only so much.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We got two loads of laundry done in the rain, filled the tanks 
				and still had water going to waste.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris and Derek 
				were quite happy to be on the boat, while everyone else was 
				hunkered down waiting for a break in the rain on their hike.<br />
				<br />
				The next day, it was only spotty rain and it cleared off and we&nbsp; 
				were able to enjoy a nice potluck on the beach with about 12 
				other boats in the anchorage.<br />
				<br />
				We decided to take a tour with &quot;Emily Grace&quot;, &quot;Pollux&quot;, and 
				&quot;Windchasers&quot;.&nbsp; We drove to Chaudie pool and took a hike 
				and then went diving in the pool.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris and Derek had 
				done this last time we were in Dominica, but it was new to 
				everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp; We then went and bought some casava 
				bread which is a locally made bread from the Casava plant.&nbsp; 
				It is a quite heave bread and flavored with coconut and ginger.&nbsp; 
				We went on to the Karibugng area where most of the local Carib 
				Indians are settled and bought some home made baskets.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The baskets are beautiful and very reasonably priced.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				After a nice lunch at a local restaurant then we went to the&nbsp; 
				red rocks area, of interesting red clay canyons and formations.&nbsp; 
				Played there for a while, and then to a beautiful river.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				If you swam across the river, a small area was set off where hot 
				springs flowed&nbsp; into a small pool.&nbsp; Due to the recent 
				rains, the pool was only lukewarm, so not everyone braved the 
				river swim.<br />
				<br />
				Lots seen and a long day.&nbsp; The next morning we went over to 
				say goodbye to &quot;Moana Roa&quot;, as they were taking off, and we 
				would not see them again.&nbsp; - At least that is what we 
				thought.<br />

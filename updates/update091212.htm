				We decided that the weather looked good for a overnight trip 
				from there to Cape May, NJ, and if the winds were nice, and seas 
				were favorable, maybe a two night trip to Norfolk, VA area.<br />
				<br />
				We had great winds of 15 to 20 knots, and when they stayed close 
				to 18 knots and above, we put in a reef in the main.&nbsp; Then 
				the lessoned/practicing began:, the winds lightened so we took a 
				reef out, then they built so we put a reef in, then they built 
				again so we put in a second reef, then they lessoned so we took 
				a reef out, then they built so we put a reef in.&nbsp; Nothing 
				like practice, practice, practice to make you good.&nbsp; Keep 
				in mind that this all occurred during the night, when one of us 
				was off shift and trying to sleep,&nbsp; All in all, it was 
				fine, and we had a good sail with mostly above 15 knots, to 27 
				knots with mellow seas, except for one four hour period.&nbsp; 
				We passed Cape May at 2:00 in the morning, so headed for 
				Norfolk, VA, but the wind finally died to nothing so had to 
				motor the last 12 hours.<br />
				<br />
				It would have not been so bad, but it was cold&nbsp; cold cold 
				cold.&nbsp; Guess we have thin blood, because both Kris and Dean 
				were in warm weather clothes, Kris had long johns on for a full 
				24 hours, plus layers on top of that.&nbsp; Only Derek did not 
				have on warm clothes, mostly because he has none, having 
				outgrown all long pants he owned, so he stayed inside wrapped in 
				a blanket most of the day.&nbsp; It finally warmed up once the 
				wind died, but the nights are still chilly outside.<br />
				<br />
				As we came down the coast we passed Atlantic City at night.&nbsp; 
				There is one building there that has the entire outside as a lit 
				up billboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is like a 20 story building at 
				least, it is quite a site from the water.&nbsp; A little south 
				of Atlantic city Kris noticed some weird lights in the sky.&nbsp; 
				She called Derek up and they watched them for a while (Dean was 
				trying to sleep).&nbsp; The lights just looked light they hung 
				in the sky in the same place for a long time.&nbsp; Then finally 
				they started moving towards the boat.&nbsp; When they got close 
				enough, you could hear the drone of an engine, so we assumed 
				that they were two airplanes, but the lights were not like 
				normal airplane lights, they were light up very bright, with 
				lights on the front and the tail, and not the wings, and a very 
				bright strobe light on one as well.&nbsp; It is easy to see why 
				people spot UFO&#39;s.<br />
				<br />
				During the day, Dean called us out all excited to see the 
				whales.&nbsp; Only Dean saw them, and they didn&#39;t resurface.<br />
				<br />
				After we started motoring, we turned on the water maker, as we 
				were half a tank low.&nbsp; After a few hours Kris asked Dean 
				how the water tank looked.&nbsp; It was empty.&nbsp; We found 
				the leak, which was a new hose we had connected for a new stern 
				shower we put in.&nbsp; Not sure what caused the hose to come 
				off, but it is a good thing we were motoring and able to make 
				water for a long time, as the entire fresh water tank emptied 
				into the bilge and was pumped overboard.&nbsp;

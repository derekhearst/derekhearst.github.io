				The passage from the BVIs to St. Martin was slow and bumpy but 
				we made it without issues.&nbsp; We anchored on the NW side of 
				St. Martin in Marigot bay and then checked in the next day.&nbsp; 
				This side of St. Martin is ruled by the French and the 
				restaurants and bakeries really give you that feeling of France.&nbsp; 
				The anchorage became rolly over the night so the next morning we 
				moved into Simpson Bay Lagoon.<br />
				<br />
				There are many cruisers here, some never leave the island, some 
				are headed south and others north.&nbsp; In the morning there is 
				a cruisers net on the VHF and one of the boats who contacted us 
				was and old friend from last year Sea Schelle.&nbsp; Sea Schelle 
				had been in the Bahamas with us but spent the hurricane season 
				in St. Croix and then has been doing the Eastern Caribbean this 
				year so this is the first time we have caught up with them.&nbsp; 
				They were also anchored in the lagoon so we moved beside them 
				and caught up with past adventures.&nbsp; Sea Schelle has three 
				girls, Sage, Jona and Ayla&nbsp; are2,&nbsp; 8 and 10 so Derek had a couple of 
				playmates.<br />
				<br />
				On Tuesday April 30th the Dutch side of St. Martin ended their 
				Carnival month with a parade.&nbsp; Taking the local bus over to 
				the Dutch side we just missed the 1st two floats/bands/dancers 
				but caught the rest of the parade.&nbsp; This is our first 
				carnival and I was not prepared for the loud loud loud music.&nbsp; 
				Did I mention it was loud.&nbsp; The speakers for the bands were 
				so powerful that when you were close to the bass speakers you 
				would think your heart took on the beat of the music vs. your 
				own heart rhythm.&nbsp; Not sure how the dancers survived being 
				that close to the speakers but everyone seemed to be having a 
				good time.&nbsp; Of course the free drinks that were being 
				offered I am sure helped everyone&#39;s attitudes.<br />
				<br />
				Did not know that May 1st is &quot;May Day&quot; a holiday for just about 
				every nation except for the U.S.&nbsp; Kind of interesting to see 
				and hear about some of the pros/cons of the U.S. vs. the rest of 
				the world.<br />
				<br />
				On May 3rd the new bridge for St. Martin came into the Lagoon.&nbsp; 
				There is a new road/bridge being added by the airport to ease 
				the traffic issues on the main road.&nbsp; We were able to have 
				front row seats for the bridge coming in to the harbor.&nbsp; 
				Not sure if the channel was deep enough for the bridge so early 
				in the morning there was a backhoe digging it a bit deeper.&nbsp; 
				The anchorage we had also gave us front row seats for the 
				airplanes taking off.&nbsp; The planes are loud but we have been 
				conditioned by the Carnival so they are not too bad now.<br />
				<br />
				A good weather window opened up, so after an incredible French 
				lunch, complete with dessert, we will head out to our next stop, 
				which is the island of Antigua.</div>

				We had the pleasure of having Dean&#39;s younger brother and his 
				family come and stay with us for a week.&nbsp; Terry, Mary, 
				Clara, and Jacob fly down from Minneapolis MN to see the blue 
				waters, big iguanas, and experience the Bahamas lifestyle for 
				themselves.&nbsp; <a href="visitors/visitors.htm">(for a full write up on 
				their visit make sure you see the visitor page)</a>&nbsp; Terry and his family have done some major 
				traveling in the past but this time they had the pleasure of 
				spending all the time on a 38 foot boat with the What Ifers :).&nbsp; 
				So we mapped out a trip of 20 miles north to Lee Stocking Island 
				and then back.<br />
				<br />
				The weather worked out nice on their second day for the trip north 
				up to Lee Stocking Island, flat seas and 15 knots of wind.&nbsp; 
				Once we arrived everyone spent time in the warm 
				waters, they are getting in the upper 70s now.&nbsp; Of course 
				the two boys, Derek and Jacob wanted to sleep in the hammocks 
				outside but by the time the eyes were closed they were back in 
				the boat in their beds.&nbsp; In the morning a trip to Leaf Cay 
				to see the iguanas who were looking for hand outs on the beach.&nbsp; One of the concerns everyone had 
				was to make sure enough sun screen was used to cover the non 
				tanned skin.&nbsp; For most of the trip it worked but a couple 
				of times spots were missed and the bright red sunburn were 
				reminders of the vacation.<br />
				<br />
				One of Derek&#39;s planned events was to make a conch horn - a 
				conch shell that has been modified to make a sound when blown. With 
				Terry and Kris working on several prototypes a horn was finally made 
				for both Derek and Jacob.&nbsp; 
				Dean tried blowing it but not sure if the noise was better than the 
				funny face he made while blowing.&nbsp; We did get some walks on the 
				beaches and even had an Easter egg hunt during their visit.<br />
				<br />
				The trip back was not as pleasant as the trip north, seas were 
				more in the 6 to 8 foot and the winds were 20 to 25.&nbsp; We 
				made an overnight stop half way back and then finally made it 
				back to George Town the next day with seas 4 foot and winds 
				around 15.&nbsp; No one was sick during the travels but everyone 
				was happy when we pulled into the anchorage.<br />
				<br />
				After our visitors left we started to plan what our next week&#39;s 
				schedule was going to look like.&nbsp; It looks like the weather, 
				seas and wind, should allow a trip 
				out to Long Island so we are in the process of getting laundry 
				done, getting food purchased, and filling up the diesel for the trip.&nbsp; 
				Hopefully we can take off on Thursday and make it over to Long 
				Island prior to 
				the next strong weather coming in.&nbsp;We have enjoyed our time 
				in George Town but after two months it will be nice to start 
				moving again and see some of the other islands.&nbsp;

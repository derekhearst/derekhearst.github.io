				After our repair time we were able to make it up to Stratford.&nbsp; 
				We anchored just down river of the bridges and were able to walk 
				to Home Depot, WalMart, PetCo and West Marine, all the staples 
				for a cruiser. Our friends the Lawtons&#39;s came and visited our 
				boat and then the next day Macy; whom Derek has known since 
				kindergarten, came back and helped us move it to Milford.&nbsp; 
				The trip in the boat was a bit slow and boring but we made up 
				for it by pulling Derek and Macy around on the tube and both 
				enjoyed jumping into the water to cool off.&nbsp; We took Macy 
				back to her parents and then enjoyed a dinner in town with John 
				M and Monty C.<br />
				<br />
				Our next port of call was all the way up to Old Saybrook where 
				we took a free mooring at the North Cove yacht club.&nbsp; From 
				there we made a big jump, well really not that big but for what 
				we have recently been doing it was big, up to New London.&nbsp; 
				We anchored on the upstream side of the railroad bridge, close 
				to the Coast Guard Academy. We could hear the wake up music, the 
				cadence marching,&nbsp; and watch the cadets train on the small 
				sail boats in the river.&nbsp; We were the only boat at the 
				anchorage and were able to make a couple of trips on the bus to 
				Lowes and the famous Defender, a big boating supply store.<br />
				<br />
				A few days later we made it to Stonington and picked up John 
				McCraw.&nbsp; John was able to bring us all our items that we 
				had shipped to his house, it was like Christmas.&nbsp; The next 
				day we sailed/motored up to Newport RI where we hung out for the 
				Folk Festival, tickets for the event were sold out so we just 
				had to hang out and enjoy the town and all the old 
				houses/mansions.&nbsp; Now most of these places were just summer 
				homes, you know the 20,000 o 65,000 square foot get away.&nbsp; 
				One morning we had a visitor, Don Jansic and his wife Tammy came 
				by on a jet ski, they were also up for the festival and were out 
				for an early morning ride.<br />
				<br />
				We had a sail with the spinnaker over to Block Island and spent 
				the next two nights there.&nbsp; On Sunday we rented bicycles 
				and went to both ends of the island exploring - a great trip but 
				sore legs.&nbsp; From Block we headed back to Stonington and 
				dropped off John and now we are at Mystic.&nbsp; We plan on 
				being here for the next two weeks as Derek is enrolled in a 
				youth sailing school, figured it would be better to learn the 
				art of sailing from professionals vs. parents :).

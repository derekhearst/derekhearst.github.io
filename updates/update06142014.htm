				On June 4th the new buyers and surveyor came to the boat around 
				lunch time.&nbsp; The survey started, and we slowly motored up 
				river to the haul out yard, and arrived around 5 p.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				The next morning the boat was lifted out of the water and more 
				survey work was done.&nbsp; Nothing major found, so we headed 
				off to complete the paperwork.&nbsp; Title and check were 
				exchanged, and we found ourselves homeless.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we 
				hit the road.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We were in Florida, and headed west on Hwy 10 though Alabama, 
				Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and then headed more north up 
				through New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and then finally Idaho.<br />
				<br />
				We went from palm trees and sawgass to more pine to less pine 
				and more scrub to nothing and red rock canyons.&nbsp;&nbsp;
				<br />
				<br />
				A rest stop in Mississippi was having hospitality month, so we 
				got free cake, but the rest is a blur of hotel rooms, rest 
				stops, fast food, and highway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We really 
				didn&#39;t spot a place where we thought &quot;this is home&quot;, until 
				Flagstaff, Arizona.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the first place where 
				Derek said &quot;I could live here!&quot;<br />
				<br />
				We stopped at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico - which is HUGE - 
				and we only saw part of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also hit 
				Roswell, New Mexico, and went to the UFO museum and research 
				center.&nbsp; &quot;We are not alone&quot;.<br />
				<br />
				We stopped at the Grand Canyon and did a short tour, and then up 
				to Dean&#39;s brothers house in Nampa Idaho.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We got a storage unit, and were finally able to unload the van, 
				and also got re-acquainted with some items that Lee has been 
				storing for us.<br />
				<br />
				It was a long drive, and now we will visit family for a while in 
				Idaho, Oregon, and Montana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kris is looking 
				for work, and we will figure things out as they happen.</div>

				We are here in Georgetown, but we did leave for a short trip and 
				sailed up to Staniel Cay and back, with a couple of stops in 
				between.&nbsp; While anchored in Georgetown we had a couple of 
				fishy friends hang out with us.&nbsp; A couple of remora&#39;s found 
				a home beneath our boat and were there for the 4 days we were at 
				anchor.&nbsp; They are strange looking fish, and we found out 
				that they enjoyed eating leftover pasta, dog food, bread, and 
				most anything else, except lettuce.<br />
				<br />
				Off of Rudder Cay, which is privately owned, there is a small 
				bay and if you dive down, you can see a statue of a mermaid at a 
				piano.&nbsp; Rumor has it that the island is owned by David 
				Copperfield, and that is also who placed the statue, but who 
				knows.&nbsp; We just know it was fun to snorkel.&nbsp; The 
				current was ripping when we went to snorkel and it took 
				everything we had to stay in place.&nbsp; It took Derek three 
				tries to get down the 15&#39; to the statue and stay in place for 
				the photos.&nbsp; It was everything Kris could do just to stay 
				in place against the current to get the photos.<br />
				<br />
				The next stop was at a large sandbar - at least at low tide it 
				is.&nbsp; It was fun to anchor out in the middle of nowhere 
				(seas were light), and then go walking on the sand in the middle 
				of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We saw lots of starfish and sand 
				dollars, and Sam enjoyed chasing the ball.<br />
				<br />
				At Big Farmers Cay, we got to swim with a sea turtle, who was 
				quite large.&nbsp; We swam with some turtles in the Grenadines, 
				but this guy was much bigger.<br />
				<br />
				Up at Staniel we went out for a nice dinner with &quot;Good Trade&quot; 
				and their guests, and then headed back to Georgetown with &quot;Good 
				Trade&quot;. Near the end of April is a Family Regatta, which the 
				locals party and sail their home made local sailboats in races 
				which will be fun to see.<br />
				<br />
				Dean and Sam go for their daily walk on the beach here, while 
				Derek does school with Kris.&nbsp; After lunch, then Dean play 
				volleyball, and Derek goes knee boarding, or other stuff with 
				the kids around.&nbsp; Kris usually works on boat projects 
				(trying to get it all spiffy looking to sell), or goes for a 
				walk or reads a good book.<br />
				<br />
				Life in Georgetown is comfortable, we all get into a nice 
				routine.&nbsp; Grocery stores and other stores are close by if 
				something is needed, and most of all - IT IS WARM!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				We just can&#39;t seen to head north yet, as we get chilled at 
				nights here, we can&#39;t imagine life below 70 degrees.&nbsp; 
				Hopefully in May when we head back, Florida will be warm enough 
				for us.</div>

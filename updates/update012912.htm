				Sail boat racing in Bahamas is taken very seriously, at 
				least the racing part.&nbsp; Afterwards the celebration and 
				discussions take on a different more relaxed atmosphere.&nbsp; 
				The boats are built by various builders and each island and builder really takes the 
				boat building and racing very seriously and besides the pride of winning 
				there is the bragging rights that come with it. Not just the 
				boat builder but the entire island gets to share in it.<br />
				<br />
				There are three classes of boats with the A 
				class being the longest, around 29 feet long, then the B class at 
				around 22 and the C at around 17 feet.&nbsp; 
				So once you have gone ahead designed it and built it how do you 
				move the boat to the water?&nbsp; Well you ask about for any 
				local bodies and organize a boat moving party.&nbsp; There were 
				two class C boats that needed to get into the water at the 
				anchorage we have been at.&nbsp; So Dean, gee 
				can you spot that brightly colored person, helped many others 
				move the boat from the storage and boat building area to the 
				water.&nbsp; This involved moving the boat over rocks, down 
				roads, over a gravel road, and finally down a slippery rocky 
				beach.&nbsp; Both boats made it successfully into the water and 
				no one was injured.&nbsp; I doubt in the US the moving of boats 
				would have occurred this way.<br />
				<br />
				One race will be at the 
				5 F festival and then another larger one will be in George Town.&nbsp; 
				In the US for a boat race all the boats are milling about the 
				start line until the gun sounds and then off to the windward 
				mark.&nbsp; Here the rules are a bit different, everyone is 
				anchored and the sails are down and when the gun goes off the 
				anchors come in and the sails go up.&nbsp; Sounds rather exciting.&nbsp; 
				Another part of the boat design is there are boards that go out 
				over the edge of the boat that people sit on to help offset the 
				amount of sail in strong winds.&nbsp; The boards are normally 
				parallel to the water but as the wind increases the angle on the 
				boards increase.&nbsp; We have seen the board at a good 45 
				degrees to the water.<br />
				<br />
				Kris has been walking with Sam a lot, and took a longer walk the 
				other day and wore poor Sam out.&nbsp; We think that Sam got 
				some water in his lungs as he was drinking, and just could not 
				get his breath.&nbsp; Kris ended up carrying him on her 
				shoulders part way home of the 2 mile walk back.&nbsp; (Sam 
				weighs 45 lbs)&nbsp; Kris says her shoulders are sore now - I 
				wonder why.&nbsp; Sam has recovered fully by the way.&nbsp; On 
				the walk she came across the unique castle house in the photo.&nbsp;
				<br />
				In many places on the islands you will find these &quot;sink holes&quot; 
				for lack of a better term - they are roundish holes filled with 
				water.&nbsp; Some have fish in them, so we suspect the rock is 
				so porous here, that there are many small fissures running all 
				under the islands.&nbsp; The sink hole in the picture was about 
				1/2 a mile inland from any water, and had little fish and crabs 
				in it.</div>

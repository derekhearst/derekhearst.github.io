				We are making our way east and next on the journey is visiting 
				the British Virgin Islands. The islands make up part of the 
				Virgin Islands archipelago, the remaining islands constitute the 
				US Virgin Islands and the Spanish Virgin Islands.&nbsp; The BVIs 
				are composed of 50 islands and cays, only 15 islands are 
				inhabited.<br />
				<br />
				We checked in at the West End of Tortola and started watching 
				all the credit card captains.&nbsp; The area is very popular for 
				chartering boats and the majority are very good skippers but 
				there are always some that take the boat to a new level,<cite> 
				<a href="http://vimeo.com/22630270">http://vimeo.com/22630270</a>&nbsp; </cite>We did 
				assist a power boat who had not tied down their dingy well 
				enough and the 3 to 4 foot waves were trying to remove it from 
				the stern of their boat.&nbsp; Luckily the dingy did not come 
				off but the fuel tank did manage to get removed and we were able 
				to fish it out and give it back to the owners.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				One of the cruising guide&#39;s &quot;have to see stops&quot; is called Foxy&#39;s.&nbsp; It is a 
				small bar/restaurant on Jost Van Dyke island that has been there 
				forever and is quiet the spot.&nbsp; Kris&#39;s engine guru &quot;Brian&quot; 
				had worked many years in the area and had 
				donated a Volvo engine to Foxy for their sailboat program.&nbsp; 
				We stopped to get an update from Foxy, 
				and give Brian some updates.<br />
				<br />
				After Foxy&#39;s we had to hide out for 3 days due to strong winds, 
				but luckily our friends on &quot;Good Trade&quot; and &quot;No 
				Rehearsal&quot; we 
				hiding with us.&nbsp; We were able to have a nice social time and 
				some good company while waiting for the winds to abate, Good 
				Trade took the Mexican Train honors.&nbsp; 
				After the winds died moved to Normans 
				Island, and took a nice walk with &quot;Remi D&quot;.&nbsp; They have a 
				younger girl, who Derek gets along with well and Sam enjoyed 
				playing with their two small dogs as well.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We moved over to Tortola, because we needed to check out and get 
				a new Health Certificate for Sam.&nbsp; Kris took a taxi ride to 
				get to the vet, and actually had to get out of the taxi early on 
				the way back, because she had the worlds worst taxi driver, and 
				nearly got in three accidents for the 5 mile ride.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				The &quot;Baths&quot; are one of the most famous and definitely a &quot;must 
				see&quot; item in the BVI&#39;s.&nbsp;&nbsp; We spent a great day there, 
				snorkeling and playing in the rocks, and &quot;Remi D&quot; joined us, so 
				Derek and Remi had a grand time playing and swimming.&nbsp;
				From there we headed north and left the BVIs and headed to St. 
				Martin.<br />

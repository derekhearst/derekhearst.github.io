				Well, we thought we might head offshore after spending a couple 
				of warm nights at the marina in South Carolina.&nbsp; Dean 
				thought the weather looked good, Kris disagreed.&nbsp; We headed 
				offshore based on Dean&#39;s thought that the wind would clock.&nbsp; 
				The weather was predicted to be 15 to 20 knots out of the west, 
				clocking to northwest.&nbsp; We headed offshore.&nbsp; After 
				about 2 hours of getting the snot beat out of us, we found the 
				closest inlet back inshore and headed for it.&nbsp; Four more 
				hours of getting pounded by seas, and wind which was 20 to 35 
				knots out of the west and clocking southwest, and we finally 
				found shelter back on the ICW in Georgia near Savannah.&nbsp; 
				Dean was wrong and Kris was right.<br />
				<br />
				After a much needed good nights sleep, we decided that it would 
				be a few days before the ocean settled down for some good 
				sailing, so we would start motoring south on the the Georgia 
				ICW, which we had never done.&nbsp; We passethrough Savannah, 
				Georgia, and seeing the homes along the waterway was very 
				interesting.&nbsp; Typical what you would think of the Georgia 
				old distinguished home.&nbsp; There is some money there in homes 
				and in boats.&nbsp; The further south on the ICW things started 
				to change.&nbsp; The geology there is mostly marshland with 
				meandering waterways all though it, but it seemed that if there 
				was a piece of dry land anywhere, you would find a small house 
				on it.&nbsp; Most times, the house was only accessible by water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				Some of the homes looked quite nice, and others a little rough, 
				like in our photo.&nbsp; It stayed cold, but the days were sunny 
				and the scenery interesting.<br />
				<br />
				After four uneventful days of motoring (we won&#39;t mention Dean 
				running aground briefly), we arrived in St. Augustine, Florida.&nbsp; 
				Kris got us off and back into the channel.<br />
				<br />
				We had been having problems with our port engine.&nbsp; It ran 
				fine, but the amount of white smoke coming out the exhaust was 
				worrying Kris something awful.&nbsp; Kris called her hero and 
				master of Volvo engines, Brian McDonnell of McDonnell Marine 
				Service in Connecticut.&nbsp; Over the phone Brian diagnosed the 
				issue as not white smoke, but white steam and told Kris to look 
				at the mixing elbow.&nbsp; We installed the new mixing elbow 
				while in St. Augustine, and Kris was finally able to sleep 
				nights with the problem solved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check out the 
				photos Brian and give yourself a pat on the back for a job well 
				done.<br />
				<br />
				After St. Augustine, we motor sailed down the ICW in Florida.&nbsp; 
				We made great time with wind 8 to 20 knots out of the north we 
				motorsailed with one engine and our jib.&nbsp; We were quite 
				proud of our boat and ourselves, as we passed by several other 
				boats, and had better speed than&nbsp; a 45&#39; Lagoon Catamaran,&nbsp; 
				and a 45&#39; Voyage Catamaran as well. <br />
				<br />
&nbsp;We were able to get into Cocoa early enough to grab a bite for dinner at 
				Five Guys Burgers with Phil Lago, who is Deans, cousin Linda&#39;s 
				husband.&nbsp; You might recall we spent Thanksgiving with them 
				last year.&nbsp; We had a great time with Phil, unfortunately 
				Linda was in Washington at the time, so we did not get to see 
				her.<br />
				<br />
				We are now in Vero Beach, Fl.&nbsp; We will get some much needed 
				groceries and then down to Stuart, Fl, where Kris&#39;s folks are 
				driving out from Oregon to meet us.&nbsp; Should be a fun week, 
				and a good time to do some serious provisioning for the trip to 
				the Bahamas and beyone.</div>

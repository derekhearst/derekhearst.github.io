				We are still here in George Town.&nbsp; This week has been the 
				32nd annual George Town Cruisers regatta.&nbsp; Lots of 
				activities and fun.&nbsp; With about 230 boats here there is 
				always something to do.&nbsp; 
				Kris and Derek did the pet parade, and got chocolate and candy 
				prizes.&nbsp; Derek did the piñata and got more candy.&nbsp; 
				Kris organized a kids play day with capture the flag, tug o war 
				and volleyball for around the 16 kids that are here now.&nbsp;
				Derek with the other kids did a skit about the constellations on 
				opening night talent show and he was the &quot;big dipper&quot; and did a 
				really good job.<br />
				<br />
				Dean was in the Coconut challenge, 
				where they empty around 1100 coconuts into a small bay.&nbsp; 
				Then teams of 4 in a dinghy using only a flipper for propulsion 
				try to round up as many coconuts as they can.&nbsp; There were 
				about 50 dinghies out there collecting coconuts.&nbsp; Then 
				there was the coconut toss, where a team member tossed coconuts 
				over his head behind him to two others with a garbage sack who 
				had to catch them.&nbsp; The final event was throwing coconuts 
				over a volleyball net into a bull&#39;s-eye on the ground for 
				points.&nbsp; Deans team came in third overall, which was really 
				good.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				Deans next event is regulation volleyball, which will happen on 
				March 8th.<br />
				<br />
				Deans older brother Lee and wife Edie will be visiting with us 
				this week, so look for an update on their visit next.<br />

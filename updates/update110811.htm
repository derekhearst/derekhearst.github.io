				Calabash SC which someone told me is the sea food capital, isn&#39;t 
				that right Tony :).&nbsp; There seems to be many people using 
				cast nets to get shrimp, heard these shrimp are the best around.&nbsp; 
				While at the dock in Charleston the local aquarium was out 
				fishing for seaweed shrimp and at night we hear snapping shrimp 
				and then there is the &quot;eating&quot; shrimp, and if you watch the 
				movie &quot;Forest Gump&quot; you know there are many ways to cook/eat 
				shrimp. On and off the docks or in small boats people are able 
				to catch quite a few shrimp and fish with these nets.&nbsp; Tony 
				also said they are easy enough even I could learn to operate 
				one.<br />
				<br />
				The plan from here, Beaufort SC, is to make an overnight sail to 
				southern Georgia/northern Florida and visit Cumberland Island 
				where there is a large wild horse population.&nbsp; From there 
				it is into Florida and we are still planning on watching a space 
				launch at Cape Canaveral of a rocket taking a rover to Mars.&nbsp; 
				It may not be the shuttle but it has to be an impressive sight.&nbsp; 
				Dean has a cousin that lives in that area so we need to stop and 
				catch up on family activities.&nbsp; After that we need to find 
				a good route to make it to the BVIs, the problem is distance and 
				the trade winds.&nbsp; The trade winds work against the 
				direction you want to go and it is a long way out to the island.&nbsp; 
				Oh well, we have some more time to work on a plan and there are 
				many people and ideas on how to get there.<br />
				<br />
				Most days have been busy with Derek&#39;s school taking up the 
				morning and then either project work or seeing the local sites 
				in the afternoon.&nbsp; The people have been very friendly and 
				usually offer suggestions of sites to see and places not to 
				miss.&nbsp; We are re-seeing some of the boats and people we have met 
				earlier and everyone is looking for the same thing, warmer 
				weather :).&nbsp; It seems like we finally get to a place where the 
				mornings are above 50 and then the cold weather comes again.&nbsp; It 
				could be worse though -&nbsp;&nbsp; talking to friends in the 
				west and east the winter is coming fast and they are seeing 
				mornings in the 20s.<br />

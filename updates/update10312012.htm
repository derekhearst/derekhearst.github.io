				Well, a lot has happened in the past few weeks.&nbsp; We had 
				mentioned an engine oil leak that needed worked on in Beaufort, 
				NC.&nbsp; Well we worked on it, and put a new rear seal on the 
				starboard engine.&nbsp; We think it is named a rear seal because 
				it was a pain in the rear to work on.&nbsp; We had to lift the 
				engine up, separate it from the transmission, pull it forward 
				and disconnect a bunch of stuff.&nbsp; Of course 14 bolts were 
				frozen, and it took us a full day just to get the bolts out.&nbsp; 
				Once everything was off, replacing the seal, and reassembling 
				was pretty easy - or so we thought!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				We motored on out of Beaufort, hit the ocean and went for an 
				overnight motor sailed down to Charleston.&nbsp;&nbsp; Part way 
				there, Kris got the bright idea to check the engine -and found 
				the oil leak was even worse.&nbsp; We shut down that engine and 
				motored on the other one.&nbsp; Any guesses what we had to do 
				again once we got anchored in Charleston - that&#39;s right, back to 
				dismantling part of the engine and doing the job again.&nbsp; 
				Had to have a new seal overnighted to the post office.&nbsp; We 
				found the first seal had a bad spot in it.&nbsp; Whether it was 
				due to our installation, or a faulty seal we will never know - 
				the important part is - the oil leak is now fixed, and we are 
				pretty good and lifting and moving our engine now.<br />
				<br />
				Of course, now Hurricane Sandy was bearing down the coast, and 
				the anchorage in Charleston was getting pretty lumpy.&nbsp; We 
				finished the engine job at 2:00 in the afternoon, and made the 
				2:30 bridge opening to get out of there.&nbsp; The next day we 
				found a nice creek to anchor in with good protection.&nbsp; 
				There was a shrimp dock by the anchorage and we went in and 
				bought two pounds of shrimp for $12, and had a feast that night.<br />
				We had no real winds and no waves from Sandy, so after a couple 
				of nights we headed on down to Beaufort, SC.<br />
				<br />
				It got pretty cold, so after one very cold night at anchor, Kris 
				put her foot down (group consensus really) and we moved to a 
				dock to we could plug into shore power and get some heat.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				In the picture, you can&#39;t read it, but Kris turned the heat up 
				to 80 degrees, and was loving life, till Dean came back from 
				outside and felt like he was in a sauna.&nbsp; We settled for 74 
				degrees.<br />
				<br />
				So here we are - Halloween night, hunkered down in our boat on 
				this cold night eating candy and will watch a scary movie.<br />
				<br />
				Tomorrow we plan on heading offshore for an overnight trip 
				further south to get warm.&nbsp; We will let you know.<br />
				<br />
				Boo!<br />

				On our way from Culebra to Puerto Rico, we made a one night stop 
				to check out the underwater camera.&nbsp; We were a little 
				disappointed because the water was more cloudy than last time we 
				were here, but we needed to get that camera wet - so we did - 
				and as you can see - it worked just fine.<br />
				<br />
				Our trip to Fajardo in Puerto Rico was primarily as a spot to stage for the 
				trip to the Bahamas.&nbsp; It was also a spot to have some 
				packages sent to, a spot where we could do some provisioning, 
				and a spot to do some sight seeing.<br />
				<br />
				The water maker has been having a couple of problems and the 
				company has been working with us to fix them.&nbsp; First we 
				found a leak at the end of the reverse osmosis vessel, the 
				company sent replacements and the leak was fixed.&nbsp; During 
				the time it took to fix the leak we also noticed the pressure to 
				run the water maker would not go above 800 psi, in the past you 
				could have taken up to 900.&nbsp; So working with the company 
				they suggested looking at the brushes in the electric motor that 
				drives the high pressure pump.&nbsp; After several attempts we 
				located a person in the BVIs that told us the brushes were less 
				than 50%.&nbsp; Now all we needed to do was replace them, 
				finding them is an issue.&nbsp; The company said they would send 
				us replacements but we needed a shipping address, luckily we 
				were able to use the SunBay&#39;s Marina location.<br />
				<br />
				The second package was from Amazon - don&#39;t you love what you can 
				buy and have shipped.&nbsp; Derek has become interested in the 
				yoyo and the one he currently has is not good enough for 
				tricks.&nbsp; After some research and looking he found a new and 
				improved one that he needed.&nbsp; That came along with a new Oral B 
				toothbrush for him.&nbsp; <br />
				<br />
				In the third package was more school work but this time it is 
				for Kris and Dean.&nbsp; One of the goals after the trip is 
				completed is to take and pass the Coast Guard Captain&#39;s License.&nbsp; 
				There are several ways to study for the test from a two week 
				class, on line, and books/CD that you self study with.&nbsp; We 
				thought with the time we have left on the trip the self study 
				would be the way to go so the third package had that material.&nbsp; 
				Now it will be up to Kris and Dean to study so when we get back 
				to the states we can sit down and try and pass that test.<br />
				<br />
				So now that the packages were taken care of it was time to rent 
				a car and go BUY more stuff for the boat.&nbsp; On Tuesday we 
				moved the boat 1/2 mile, fueled up with diesel, and parked it in 
				slip C 55/53.&nbsp; We had arranged for Enterprise to come pick 
				us up and off we went to do some shopping. <br />
				<br />
				We drove over 140 miles on the first day, and mostly looking for 
				a kneeboard for Derek.&nbsp; We finally found out that people in 
				Puerto Rico don&#39;t really kneeboard, so the only place that might 
				have one is West Marine.&nbsp; We got to West Marine at 4:44 in 
				the afternoon, to find a sign on the door saying that they 
				closed at 4:30 for inventory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guess we would have to 
				drive the 70 miles back in the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did get 
				a new gps navigator for the car though, so hopefully, won&#39;t get 
				lost with our driving.<br />
				<br />
				The next day we were out the door at 8:00 for another busy day.&nbsp; 
				We drove to West Marine, and did get a kneeboard for Derek, and 
				then onto the Arecibo Observatory.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you say 
				observatory, most people think of huge telescopes to look at 
				stars, but this observatory is a listening observatory.&nbsp; 
				They listen for the radio waves that emanate from all objects in 
				space, and from the waves can create a 3-D model of the objects.&nbsp; 
				(kind of like radar, but more advanced)&nbsp; The observatory is 
				quite impressive and we enjoyed seeing it.<br />
				<br />
				The next stop was the Camuy Caves.&nbsp; We were a little 
				disappointed in how the cave was managed, but the cave was 
				spectacular.<br />
				<br />
				The highlight of the trip was that we got to meet up with our 
				friends Jack and Marce on Escape Velocity.&nbsp;&nbsp; They 
				unfortunately got stuck in Puerto Rico longer than they wanted 
				due to some navigation instrument repairs that were needed, but 
				lucky for us because we got to see them again.&nbsp; We went out 
				for a nice dinner, and had a lot of fun, but on the sad side - 
				had to say goodbye once again.&nbsp; Escape Velocity is headed 
				across the Pacific and we wish them safe travels.<br />
				<br />
				We still had shopping to do, so extended our stay in the marina, 
				and car rental one more day and did the mega shopping trip to 
				the Super Wal-Mart and Ralphs grocery store.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think 
				we are good on everything but fresh produce for the next three 
				months, but we are all really tired of driving and shopping.<br />
				<br />
				Now we just need the wind to cooperate for the next trip to the 
				Bahamas.<br />

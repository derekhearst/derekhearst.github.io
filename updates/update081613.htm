				After a month in one spot it was time for a changeof view so we 
				headed north to St. Vincent and the Grenadines.&nbsp; This 
				country has one large island of St. Vincent, and several smaller 
				islands generally called the Grenadines.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is about 40 miles north, 
				of where we were anchored, we had passed it on our way down, so 
				decided to go back north and see some of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We 
				battened down the hatches and along with Day Dreamer headed on a 
				pleasant 40 mile sail up to Union Island.&nbsp; After one night 
				at Clifton Harbor we sailed/motored out to the Tobago Cays, one 
				of the &quot;must sees&quot; in the Caribbean.<br />
				<br />
				The Tobago Cays have an area that is a wildlife preserve for sea 
				turtles.&nbsp; Many people head there to dive with them.&nbsp;We were no exception, and spent two days anchored and 
				snorkeling the reef, islands, and watching turtles.&nbsp; The 
				wind started to pick up and made the anchorage rolly so we 
				took off for another 6 mile sail to Canouan.&nbsp; Upon arriving 
				it was time to spend another afternoon in the water.&nbsp; We 
				saw several different rays and even had a Manta ray swim past 
				the boat several times, he must have recognized that our boat is 
				a Manta as well.&nbsp; We spent two days here but then had the 
				itch to move but this time we went south 6 miles to the island 
				of Mayreau.<br />
				<br />
				After several more days it was time to head to Union Island but 
				a different spot than where we checked in.&nbsp; This time we 
				anchored at Ashton which had big plans for a marina but they 
				never finished it.&nbsp; This would have been the biggest marina 
				around the Caribbean but for some reason it stopped in the first 
				30% of it&#39;s construction.&nbsp; The area did offer a great spot 
				to sit out some of the windier days in very calm water.&nbsp; It 
				did not have good beaches or good snorkeling but we still spent 
				2 days there.<br />
				The kids found a sandy spot in about 8 feet of water that had 
				hundreds of starfish.&nbsp; The collected about 50 of them in a 
				bucket for fun, but then put them all back so they would not 
				die.<br />
				<br />
				On Thursday we headed back to Carriacou which is the northern 
				island of Grenada, so we could check back into Grenada.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
				From here we will work our way back to the southern anchorages 
				of Grenada, it may take a week or so depending upon how the 
				anchorages between here and there are.<br />
				<br />
				We do a lot of snorkeling off and on, and we get to the point 
				that it takes something spectacular for us to ooh and aah 
				anymore.&nbsp; We realize that many of you haven&#39;t seen what we 
				have seen, so check out our videos and pictures to see the 
				underwater world of the Caribbean and enjoy.<br />
